## 1. Context and Rationale

The document addressed widespread ecological degradation and increasing wildfire risk across California’s Sierra Nevada. It framed the region as a critical socioecological system supporting biodiversity, water supply for approximately 39 million people, substantial carbon storage, and a multi-billion-dollar recreation economy. However, historical logging, fire exclusion, grazing, and development had transformed forest structure, resulting in dense, homogeneous stands with elevated fuel loads and disrupted fire regimes .

The report emphasized that fire suppression had reduced fire frequency below historical norms, contributing to increased megafire occurrence and severity. This dynamic posed risks to biodiversity, infrastructure, water quality, and public health. At the same time, fire suppression costs were rising sharply, reducing funds available for proactive restoration. The rationale for intervention was therefore both ecological (restoring resilience and biodiversity) and economic (improving return on restoration investments). The document positioned restoration not as discretionary conservation, but as a risk-reduction necessity under fiscal and ecological constraints.

---

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The primary objective was to conduct a systematic, regional-scale spatial assessment to identify watersheds where forest restoration would yield the greatest combined benefits for biodiversity and human infrastructure protection .

The analysis was explicitly designed to inform strategic investment planning over a 10–20 year horizon. It aimed to support prioritization decisions within US Forest Service (USFS) planning processes and broader landscape restoration initiatives. The decision context was therefore resource allocation under budget constraints, with emphasis on maximizing return on investment (ROI) in fuels reduction and restoration.

The report did not propose site-level prescriptions; rather, it defined priority landscapes at the watershed scale suitable for subsequent local planning.

---

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The intervention strategy centered on ecologically based forest restoration, particularly:

* Mechanical thinning
* Prescribed fire
* Reintroduction of mixed-severity fire regimes

The conceptual framing was resilience-oriented restoration. The NbS strategy aimed to:

* Reduce fuel loads and megafire risk
* Restore historic fire regimes
* Protect biodiversity associated with large-tree forests
* Reduce risk to infrastructure and water systems

Restoration was framed simultaneously as adaptation (reducing wildfire risk under changing climate), mitigation (carbon protection through avoided high-severity fire), and biodiversity conservation. However, carbon mitigation was not operationalized quantitatively in the prioritization framework.

The strategy assumed that restoring fire as a natural process was ecologically desirable but required mechanical pre-treatment in high-risk landscapes to avoid short-term biodiversity and infrastructure impacts.

---

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

### Geographic Scope and Scale

The study encompassed 1,149 HUC-12 watersheds intersecting the California portion of the Sierran Steppe-Mixed Forest-Coniferous Forest-Alpine Meadow Province . Watersheds ranged from 10,000 to 100,000 acres, covering ~25 million acres across seven ecoregions.

The watershed (HUC-12) was the unit of analysis, chosen for ecological coherence and management relevance.

### Prioritization Logic

Watersheds were prioritized based on three core criteria:

1. Biodiversity value
2. Departure from historic fire frequency
3. Fire risk to infrastructure

Watersheds classified as:

* High/very high biodiversity,
* Burning too infrequently relative to historic fire return intervals, and
* Moderate to high infrastructure fire risk,

were designated as priority landscapes.

This was a rule-based overlay approach rather than a formal optimization model. No explicit weighting coefficients were disclosed; instead, categorical thresholds were applied.

### Biodiversity Index Construction

Nine spatial datasets were compiled. Terrestrial metrics included:

* Connected large-tree forests
* Remnant large-tree patches
* Large-tree associated wildlife records
* Rare terrestrial species records
* Rare terrestrial habitat area

Aquatic metrics included:

* Endemic aquatic species
* Vulnerable aquatic species
* Meadow area and count

Each attribute was classified into low to very high categories using predefined thresholds (see Table 1 on p. 5). Attributes were aggregated into composite indices (Figure 2, p. 4). The aggregation logic relied on categorical normalization and matrix-based combination rather than continuous scoring.

### Fire Frequency Departure

Fire Return Interval Departure Index (PFRID) from Safford and Van de Water (2014) was used . Both mean and maximum PFRID were combined to classify watersheds as burning too little or too much relative to pre-settlement regimes. The approach emphasized ecological departure as a proxy for restoration need.

### Fire Risk to Infrastructure

The Fire Risk Index (FRI) from the Sanborn Map Company incorporated fire probability, behavior, infrastructure exposure, and suppression difficulty . Infrastructure components were weighted (e.g., infrastructure assets 46.2%, wildland development areas 44.7%). Watersheds were categorized as low, moderate, or high risk based on area-weighted mean FRI scores.

### Feasibility Analysis

Feasibility was assessed using:

* USFS fuels treatment data (FACTS database)
* Wildfire burn severity data (MTBS)
* Operability mapping using slope, road proximity, and forest cover constraints (North et al. Scenario D)

This introduced implementation realism into prioritization.

### Treatment of Uncertainty

Uncertainty was not explicitly quantified. The methodology relied on categorical thresholds, but no sensitivity analysis or scenario variation was presented.

---

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The assessment relied on publicly available, region-wide datasets, including:

* USFS eVEG vegetation maps
* California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB)
* Freshwater Species Database
* Meadow GIS datasets
* CALVEG classification
* Fire Return Interval Departure datasets
* Fire Risk Index (Sanborn)
* MTBS wildfire data
* FACTS treatment records

The exclusive reliance on publicly available datasets improved replicability but may have introduced spatial resolution and completeness limitations, particularly for private lands (feasibility analysis focused primarily on USFS lands).

The report acknowledged limited fuels data outside USFS ownership.

---

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

The primary outputs included:

* Biodiversity maps (Figure 3, p. 8)
* Fire departure maps
* Infrastructure risk maps
* Composite priority watershed map (Figure 5, p. 10)

The analysis identified 146 priority watersheds (13% of total), totaling ~3.5 million acres, including 1.9 million acres of conifer forest .

Quantitative comparisons demonstrated that priority watersheds contained:

* ~1.5–2× higher concentrations of rare and endemic species
* ~40% of the region’s Wildland Urban Interface
* 1.3 million acres of operable forest

The outputs supported spatial targeting rather than quantifying carbon, avoided fire severity, or economic benefits.

---

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was implicitly referenced through drought-induced mortality and increasing wildfire severity, but climate projections were not explicitly integrated into spatial modeling .

Risk was operationalized primarily through:

* Fire return interval departure (ecological risk)
* Infrastructure exposure (socioeconomic risk)

Future climate scenarios were not modeled, and no dynamic risk projections were incorporated.

---

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic considerations were indirect. The report emphasized rising fire suppression costs and limited restoration budgets. However:

* No cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted.
* No ROI or NPV modeling was included.
* No explicit cost layer was integrated into prioritization.

Implementation feasibility was assessed via operability constraints and recent treatment history. Approximately 7.4 million acres of conifer forest were identified as operable .

Governance integration was discussed conceptually (e.g., USFS planning, Tahoe-Central Sierra Initiative), but not analytically.

---

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

No formal validation or sensitivity testing was reported. The prioritization logic depended on categorical thresholds, which may introduce classification sensitivity. Key limitations include:

* Lack of weighting transparency across biodiversity attributes
* No quantitative trade-off analysis
* Limited treatment of private land data
* No uncertainty quantification
* Static analysis without dynamic climate scenarios

The approach was spatially comprehensive but methodologically heuristic.

---

## 10. Critical Assessment

The report demonstrated strong ecological grounding and transparent use of established datasets. Its watershed-scale framing was appropriate for landscape planning and aligned with hydrological and fire regime processes. However, the prioritization relied on rule-based overlay methods without formal multi-criteria weighting, optimization, or sensitivity testing. Climate change was acknowledged but not analytically integrated. Economic analysis was limited to qualitative justification rather than quantitative cost-benefit modeling. The absence of uncertainty treatment constrains robustness claims. Nonetheless, the framework was scalable and transferable to other fire-prone regions, provided similar datasets exist. Overall, the methodology was strategically sound but analytically conservative, prioritizing clarity and usability over computational sophistication.","Mechanical thinning; Prescribed fire; Reintroduction of mixed-severity fire regimes","eVEG vegetation maps (USFS); CNDDB (California Natural Diversity Database); Freshwater Species Database (Freshwater Species Database); Meadow GIS datasets (Meadow GIS); CALVEG classification (CALVEG); Fire Return Interval Departure (Safford and Van de Water 2014); Fire Risk Index (Sanborn Map Company); MTBS wildfire data (MTBS); FACTS treatment records (FACTS); Endemic aquatic species (Freshwater Species Database); Vulnerable aquatic species (Freshwater Species Database); Meadow area and count (Meadow GIS datasets); Connected large-tree forests (USFS eVEG vegetation maps); Remnant large-tree patches (USFS eVEG vegetation maps); Large-tree associated wildlife records (California Natural Diversity Database); Rare terrestrial species records (California Natural Diversity Database); Rare terrestrial habitat area (CALVEG classification); Slope (North et al.

"Forest Protection & Sustainable Management",2,"A Guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)","Methodological working paper","Widely applied framework for national/regional forest restoration planning – it systematizes how to use spatial criteria and local inputs to produce transparent, reusable priority maps for interventions.","https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2014-030.pdf","## 1. Context and Rationale

The document framed forest landscape restoration (FLR) as a long-term, landscape-scale response to widespread forest degradation and deforestation, explicitly linking ecological functionality to human well-being outcomes across watersheds and jurisdictions.  It argued that global-scale maps of restoration potential were inherently constrained by coarse resolution and lack of country-specific data, and therefore could not reliably guide national strategies; consequently, national or sub-national assessments were presented as necessary to refine priorities, integrate local constraints, and provide decision-grade evidence for reforms and programmes.  

The rationale for ROAM was methodological as much as environmental: it aimed to structure how “best knowledge” (local expertise and stakeholder perspectives) should be combined with “best science” (existing datasets, maps, and literature) to produce credible, actionable restoration portfolios, rather than relying exclusively on either expert judgement or GIS layers.  The document also positioned itself explicitly as a “road-test edition” derived from a limited set of country applications, implying that the methodological guidance was provisional and evolving rather than a settled standard. 

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

ROAM was presented as a decision-support methodology for national or sub-national restoration planning, with a defined set of deliverables intended to inform strategic prioritisation, programme design, and enabling-condition reforms. Specifically, a ROAM application was expected to produce a shortlist of feasible intervention types, identify priority restoration areas, quantify costs and benefits by intervention, estimate additional carbon sequestration, diagnose “key success factors” and bottlenecks, and analyse finance and resourcing options. 

The intended decision context therefore extended beyond biophysical targeting to include institutional and investment decisions: results were meant to feed into policies, programmes, or strategies that aligned with national priorities such as food, water, and energy security and climate mitigation.  The document further implied that ROAM outputs should be defensible in high-level policy arenas, explicitly claiming that the integrated analytical design could withstand scrutiny at senior government level when appropriately executed. 

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The NbS framing was largely synonymous with FLR and associated land-use transitions that increased tree cover and/or improved tree management in degraded landscapes.  Intervention types were treated as a portfolio spanning tree planting, natural regeneration, silviculture, agroforestry, improved fallow, watershed and shoreline/mangrove restoration, and avoided deforestation, with examples indicating that options were adapted to national contexts.  

Conceptually, interventions were framed as multifunctional: they were expected to generate livelihood benefits, productivity improvements, ecosystem services, and mitigation co-benefits, with an explicit warning that carbon-focused paradigms (e.g., REDD+ emphasis on avoided deforestation) could overlook productive agricultural-land restoration opportunities.  This broadened framing implicitly defined NbS as a development-aligned strategy rather than a purely conservationist one, while still acknowledging biodiversity relevance and international commitments in the overall FLR rationale. 

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

ROAM was designed for national or sub-national geographic scopes, with analysis structured around a phased workflow (preparation/planning; data collection and analysis; results to recommendations).  The spatial unit of analysis depended on data availability, and the document formalised two complementary spatial logics rather than prescribing a single model. Under limited GIS data conditions, ROAM employed a “knowledge mapping” approach in which participants subdivided the assessment area into polygons characterised by similar land-use challenges, assigned feasible intervention mixes to each polygon, gauged feasibility, iteratively revised portfolios, and then digitised results.  This approach embedded deliberative judgement into the spatial product; however, it also implied that outputs were contingent on workshop consistency and the rule sets used to assign interventions (e.g., minimum polygon sizes and categorical assignment rules). 

With higher GIS data availability, ROAM used a “digital mapping” approach based on multi-layer combination and reclassification. The methodological logic followed an explicit sequence: identify restoration opportunities; select data layers corresponding to criteria; collect datasets; reclassify datasets into priority categories; combine layers; and apply algorithms to infer intervention-specific opportunity areas.  Reclassification involved mapping heterogeneous source categories to standardised priority scores (e.g., eliminated/low/medium/high) and applying weights to emphasise “most restoration-relevant criteria,” implying a multi-criteria decision analysis structure.  The Mexico example made this explicit by assigning numeric priority values and multiplying by criterion-specific weights, thereby creating an “assessment score” used to derive tiered national priority classes. 

Criteria and indicators were selected to address five “layers of analysis”: need for FLR, appropriate intervention types, land availability, economic costs/benefits, and legal/institutional/financial constraints.  The selection was portrayed as objective-driven and proxy-based, with indicators constrained by cartographic data availability (Mexico used indicators explicitly tied to national GIS datasets).  Uncertainty treatment was uneven: the document recommended sensitivity/uncertainty analysis for the economic module (including Monte Carlo simulation for ecological variability such as precipitation and tree growth), but it did not specify analogous uncertainty propagation for the spatial prioritisation layers. 

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The evidence base combined biophysical, risk, socio-economic, and governance-relevant variables assembled from existing maps, stakeholder surveys, and literature, with optional commissioning of new maps when gaps existed.   In Mexico, the document reported that technical meetings with national institutions were used to obtain digital thematic maps (e.g., forest zoning, economic pressures on forests, soil conditions, fire resilience, potential land use), and it noted that many maps were available at 1:250,000 scale—presented as sufficient for national analysis. 

Data supporting economic estimation were partly derived from stakeholder surveys: Ghana reportedly used surveys of land owners/managers to collect intervention-specific establishment and operating costs and unit costs per hectare, enabling more detailed costing than workshop-only elicitation.  For carbon estimation, the guide directed users to IPCC Good Practice approaches and included an appendix on Tier 1 methods, implying that carbon accounting could be implemented with varying sophistication depending on data. 

Data limitations were addressed indirectly through the “data availability” logic that determined whether knowledge mapping, digital mapping, or a hybrid was appropriate; this implicitly acknowledged pervasive gaps and the need for stakeholder/expert input even under strong GIS coverage. 

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

ROAM outputs were explicitly specified as both spatial and non-spatial decision products: national opportunity maps, intervention shortlists, quantified costs/benefits, carbon sequestration estimates, readiness diagnostics, and finance analyses.  Spatial outputs included (i) tiered restoration priority maps (e.g., top/second/third priority classes in Mexico based on aggregated scores from seven GIS datasets) and (ii) categorical “opportunity type” maps (e.g., Guatemala’s eight opportunity categories including riparian forests, mangroves, conservation/production forests, and agroforestry variants).  

The document emphasised that knowledge mapping could also generate quantified summaries (e.g., bar charts of hectares by intervention opportunity), positioning these as a bridge between deliberative mapping and investment discussion.  For economic decision support, ROAM promoted marginal analysis to compare incremental costs and benefits of restoration transitions, avoiding the infeasible task of valuing all landscape values.  It further linked these results to prioritisation criteria such as NPV, ROI, and multi-criteria decision-making, indicating an intent to support budgeting and portfolio selection rather than a single “optimal” map. 

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate mitigation was integrated analytically through explicit carbon sequestration estimation for intervention types using IPCC Good Practice methods, with recognition that method choice depended on focus and data availability.   Carbon was also treated as an investment-relevant co-benefit via “cost-benefit-carbon modelling,” which plotted net benefits per ton of CO₂e against national sequestration potential over a 20-year horizon. 

Risk was incorporated more prominently as a targeting variable than as future climate scenario modelling. The criteria/indicator examples included flood risk (“major flood areas during last 50 years”), slope thresholds, fire risk, and recoverability, indicating that hazard exposure and landscape sensitivity could shape prioritisation layers.   The document also treated ecological stochasticity (precipitation variability, tree growth rates) as a source of economic risk, recommending Monte Carlo simulation to represent outcome distributions rather than single-point assumptions.  Explicit future climate scenarios, downscaled projections, or climate-change constraints were not described in the accessible sections beyond these risk proxies and stochastic treatment.

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic analysis was presented as central, motivated by policy-maker concerns about costs, who pays, and whether public spending would be more effective elsewhere; it explicitly anticipated comparisons between restoration and engineered alternatives (e.g., upstream restoration versus water filtration infrastructure).  To reduce complexity, the methodology advocated marginal valuation of restoration transitions, distinguishing private (farmer) costs/benefits from externalities borne by society, which enabled distributional reasoning about financing responsibility. 

Cost treatment was decomposed into opportunity, transaction, and implementation costs, with attention to planning, land purchase, infrastructure, monitoring, and ongoing management.  The cost-benefit-carbon module explicitly cautioned against over-interpretation: like abatement curves, it did not model diminishing marginal returns as restoration expanded to more difficult hectares and should not be read as selecting a single “best” option, but rather as informing discussions on an appropriate mix of interventions. 

Implementation and governance were treated through a “diagnostic of key success factors” assessing motivations, enabling conditions, and capacity, including how policy, legal, market, and institutional arrangements could help or hinder scaling.  Finance analysis acknowledged methodological immaturity: it stated that ROAM applications had not yet produced detailed finance/investment packages, but proposed testing results with finance specialists and provided general recommendations for attracting private investment (e.g., identifying investment-worthy practices, developing business cases, using qualified financial intermediaries, and establishing reporting systems).  

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Validation was institutionalised through a capital-city validation workshop intended to assess whether conclusions and recommendations made technical, political, and institutional sense, with an explicit expectation that validation could trigger repetition of analyses using revised assumptions or additional data.  The process was also designed to enable stakeholders to challenge assumptions, and it proposed preparing alternative result sets under different assumptions for scenario-style feedback during validation. 

Robustness was more developed for the economic module than for spatial outputs: sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation were recommended to evaluate how results changed with prices, interest rates, and biological assumptions, recognising that ecological variability introduced risk into profitability estimates.  The document’s self-identified limitation was its “road-test” status and evidence base drawn from only a handful of country experiences, implying limited empirical generalisation and incomplete tool maturation (notably for finance packaging).  

## 10. Critical Assessment

Methodologically, the guide’s principal strength lay in its explicit integration of spatial prioritisation with economic valuation, governance diagnostics, and stakeholder validation, which increased the likelihood that maps translated into implementable portfolios rather than purely technical artefacts.  Analytical transparency was moderate: the digital mapping logic was clearly articulated as reclassification plus weighting plus aggregation, and the Mexico example revealed the arithmetic structure of scoring, but the guidance remained largely procedural and did not specify formal rules for choosing weights or testing spatial sensitivity to alternative weight sets.  Robustness provisions were strongest where the document recommended uncertainty analysis and Monte Carlo simulation for economic outcomes, yet equivalent uncertainty handling for spatial opportunity maps was not comparably developed, creating a potential bias toward overconfidence in mapped priorities.  The portfolio framing (and explicit caution against interpreting cost-benefit-carbon charts as a single-optimum choice) appropriately constrained misuse, but the reliance on 20-year horizons and “direct material net benefits” in examples risked under-representing long-term ecological benefits and non-market values unless users followed the guide’s broader valuation intent.   Transferability appeared high at the workflow level (phased structure; dual spatial approaches), yet outcomes would likely be highly context-dependent because intervention feasibility and polygon assignment rules were shaped by workshop judgement and national data availability.","natural regeneration; mangrove restoration; riparian forests; agroforestry variants","Forest zoning (Mexico national GIS datasets); Economic pressures on forests (Mexico national GIS datasets); Soil conditions (Mexico national GIS datasets); Fire resilience (Mexico national GIS datasets); Potential land use (Mexico national GIS datasets); Land availability (Mexico national GIS datasets); Need for FLR (ROAM criteria/indicators); Appropriate intervention types (ROAM criteria/indicators); Economic costs/benefits (Ghana stakeholder surveys); Establishment costs per hectare (Ghana stakeholder surveys); Operating costs per hectare (Ghana stakeholder surveys); Legal/institutional/financial constraints (ROAM criteria/indicators); Flood risk (ROAM criteria/indicators); Slope thresholds (ROAM criteria/indicators); Recoverability (ROAM criteria/indicators)","NA","Knowledge mapping (polygon-based, workshop-driven subdivision and assignment of feasible interventions and feasibility assessment); digital mapping (multi-layer GIS with reclassification to standard priority scores, weighting of criteria, and aggregation to produce tiered priority maps and opportunity-type maps).","Capital-city validation workshop; scenario-style feedback during validation; sensitivity analysis; Monte Carlo simulation.","ROAM (Road-test edition) (source: ROAM methodology)","ROAM (Road-test edition) : A national/sub-national decision-support methodology that blends best knowledge (local expertise and stakeholder input) with best science (datasets, maps, literature) to produce credible, actionable restoration portfolios; it delivers a shortlist of feasible intervention types, identifies priority restoration areas, quantifies costs and benefits by intervention, estimates carbon sequestration, diagnoses key success factors and bottlenecks, and analyzes finance/resourcing options to inform policies, programmes, and enabling-condition reforms; it features two spatial modes—knowledge mapping under limited GIS data (deliberative polygons, assignment rules) and digital mapping under richer GIS data (multi-layer reclassification, weighting, MCDA)—based on five analysis layers (need for FLR, appropriate intervention types, land availability, economic costs/benefits, legal/institutional/financial constraints) with uncertainty analyses (Monte Carlo for economics and ecological variability) and a road-tested, provisional status intended for iterative improvement across contexts.","National opportunity maps [national]; Tiered restoration priority maps [top/second/third] (Mexico); Categorical 'opportunity type' maps [Guatemala: eight categories including riparian forests, mangroves, conservation/production forests, and agroforestry variants]","Yes: climate-related hazards are treated as risk factors that can constrain NbS outcomes by embedding hazard exposure (flood, fire) and landscape sensitivity into prioritisation layers, thereby shaping outputs; the authors demonstrate this through hazard-based prioritisation criteria and by recommending uncertainty analyses to reflect risk in results, while noting that explicit future climate scenario modelling is not performed.","Yes: They explicitly use climate hazards as a targeting driver (e.g., flood risk areas and fire risk) to steer NbS prioritisation toward climate adaptation and mitigation benefits.

Context and Rationale

The document was developed in response to a recurrent challenge in forest landscape restoration (FLR): although ecosystem services analysis had become technically sophisticated, its outputs were often too complex to inform high-level decision-making effectively . Decision makers were not only interested in biophysical improvements but also in understanding how restoration would influence agricultural productivity, employment, income generation, and benefits to marginalized groups .

ROOT emerged from a collaboration between IUCN and The Natural Capital Project to address this communication and optimisation gap . The central problem identified was that traditional prioritisation methods, often based on static spatial overlays, could not adequately assess trade-offs among multiple ecosystem services or quantify opportunity costs . As a result, restoration planning risked being either overly simplistic (single-service targeting) or analytically fragmented (separate analyses per service). ROOT was therefore conceived to move beyond simple prioritisation toward optimisation of multiple ecosystem service objectives within explicit constraints.

---

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The explicit objective of ROOT was to provide quantifiable evidence to support restoration decisions and to ensure those decisions aligned with the needs of targeted beneficiaries . It was intended to generate optimised spatial allocations of restoration activities that maximise multiple ecosystem service benefits under defined monetary or geographic constraints .

ROOT operated within the broader Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) framework, contributing a technical optimisation component to inclusive, stakeholder-driven FLR planning processes . The decision context was therefore strategic: national and subnational governments sought to determine where to initiate restoration to maximise co-benefits (e.g., water quality, carbon, livelihoods) and justify large-scale investments .

The tool was explicitly positioned to inform policy recommendations, funding allocation, and implementation planning by identifying “optimal” locations rather than simply “high-priority” areas .

---

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The intervention logic centered on forest landscape restoration as a nature-based solution generating multiple ecosystem services. Restoration actions were conceptualised not merely as tree planting but as land-use modifications capable of altering ecosystem service provision across landscapes. In the Costa Rica case, for example, land-use types were not replaced but modified by restoration actions to generate ecological, social, and economic benefits .

NbS were framed as multifunctional strategies capable of delivering carbon sequestration, sediment retention, water yield regulation, agricultural productivity, fuelwood supply, and employment benefits. ROOT emphasised that restoration generates benefits “beyond just the biophysical realm” by connecting services to beneficiaries .

Conceptually, the tool embedded NbS within a portfolio optimisation logic: restoration was treated as a spatially allocable activity with quantifiable marginal impacts on ecosystem services, which could be compared and aggregated across objectives.

---

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

### Scale and Geographic Scope

ROOT was described as scale-independent and applicable at national or subnational scales . Case studies included Brazil, Malawi, Myanmar, Colombia, and Costa Rica, each operating at landscape or jurisdictional levels .

### Unit of Analysis and Inputs

The model required spatially explicit raster datasets representing marginal ecosystem service impacts between baseline and restoration scenarios . Six principal inputs were required: impact potential rasters, ecosystem servicesheds, composite factors, activity masks, objectives, and targets .

Impact rasters represented the difference in ecosystem service provision between baseline and restoration scenarios, thus operationalising restoration as a marginal change rather than a static condition . Beneficiary maps were also incorporated to represent spatial demand for services .

### Optimisation Logic

ROOT applied linear programming optimisation to identify optimal restoration allocations . The user defined multiple objectives combining biophysical changes and ecosystem service demand .

Critically, ROOT performed multiple optimisation runs, randomly assigning weights to each objective using a multivariate normal distribution, with weight vectors normalised to sum to one . This produced a range of optimised solutions reflecting varying stakeholder preference structures .

Rather than selecting a single optimal configuration, ROOT synthesised results into an “agreement map” indicating the frequency with which areas were selected across iterations . Areas consistently selected were interpreted as robust priorities.

### Trade-offs and Constraints

ROOT explicitly modelled trade-offs among ecosystem services and opportunity costs, enabling maximisation of two or more services simultaneously . Monetary or geographic constraints could be imposed to simulate realistic budget or area limits .

### Treatment of Uncertainty

Uncertainty was addressed indirectly through repeated optimisations with randomized weights, producing agreement maps as a measure of robustness . However, uncertainty in input data or model structure was not explicitly quantified.

---

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

Ecosystem services were typically modelled using InVEST, though ROOT was agnostic to modelling platform and could accept any spatially explicit raster data . Case studies employed models for carbon sequestration, sediment retention, water yield, and other services .

Data included biophysical service supply, beneficiary distributions, and in some cases economic and social metrics . Inputs were generally derived from ROAM processes and stakeholder-validated national datasets .

Data limitations were not extensively discussed, though the requirement for GIS expertise and high-quality spatial data implied dependence on technical capacity .

---

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

Primary outputs included optimised spatial allocation maps, agreement maps summarising solution robustness , and summary tables aggregating ecosystem service totals across solutions .

In Colombia, optimisation revealed that multi-service approaches could reduce costs by 13–95% compared to single-service strategies , demonstrating explicit cost-effectiveness gains. In Myanmar, relatively small restoration interventions were shown to influence millions of hectares in terms of service provision .

Outputs were therefore designed to inform where restoration should occur to maximise ecosystem service delivery to beneficiaries .

---

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate mitigation was integrated via carbon sequestration modelling  and explicitly linked to national mitigation planning in Costa Rica .

Risk reduction appeared in the Myanmar case as a disaster risk reduction objective . However, the document did not describe explicit incorporation of future climate scenarios or dynamic hazard projections. Climate was treated primarily through mitigation metrics and service supply-demand modelling.

---

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic considerations were incorporated through optimisation under monetary constraints  and through comparative cost analyses in case studies . ROOT also modelled quantified social benefits in some applications .

The inclusion of beneficiary maps altered prioritisation outcomes , demonstrating explicit integration of social equity considerations.

Implementation logic remained embedded in ROAM processes; ROOT itself functioned as a technical decision-support module rather than a governance framework.

---

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Robustness was represented through agreement maps derived from multiple optimisation runs . This provided a probabilistic indication of priority consistency under varying objective weights.

However, the document did not describe formal sensitivity analyses on input data quality or model parameter uncertainty. ROOT required technical GIS expertise , potentially limiting accessibility in low-capacity contexts.

---

## 10. Critical Assessment

The methodological strength of ROOT lay in its explicit use of linear programming and multi-objective optimisation to operationalise ecosystem service trade-offs . Its randomised weighting and agreement mapping provided an innovative approach to exploring stakeholder preference variability . Analytical transparency was relatively high in describing optimisation mechanics, though less detail was provided on parameter calibration or data uncertainty. Robustness was partially addressed through iterative optimisation but lacked formal error propagation analysis. The integration of beneficiary mapping represented a significant advancement in linking NbS to social outcomes . However, reliance on high-quality spatial data and technical expertise may constrain scalability in data-poor settings. Overall, ROOT represented a technically rigorous yet pragmatically oriented optimisation framework for NbS prioritisation.","NA","Impact potential rasters (ROAM processes; stakeholder-validated national datasets); Ecosystem servicesheds (ROAM processes; stakeholder-validated national datasets); Composite factors (ROAM processes; stakeholder-validated national datasets); Activity masks (ROAM processes; stakeholder-validated national datasets); Objectives (ROAM processes; stakeholder-validated national datasets); Targets (ROAM processes; stakeholder-validated national datasets); Beneficiary maps (ROAM processes; stakeholder-validated national datasets); Biophysical service supply (InVEST); Beneficiary distributions (ROAM processes; stakeholder-validated national datasets); Economic metrics (ROAM processes); Social metrics (ROAM processes)","NA","Linear programming-based multi-objective optimisation over spatial marginal impact rasters (baseline versus restoration) and beneficiary maps, using randomised objective weights (Monte Carlo) to produce agreement maps that identify robust restoration priority areas.","Agreement maps from multiple optimisation runs with randomized weights to assess robustness.","ROOT (IUCN; The Natural Capital Project); InVEST (The Natural Capital Project)","ROOT: A technical decision-support optimisation component that uses multi-objective linear programming to identify optimal spatial restoration allocations under monetary or geographic constraints, producing agreement maps and optimized allocation outputs to inform policy, funding, and implementation; InVEST: A modelling platform used to generate spatially explicit representations of ecosystem-service supply (e.g., carbon sequestration, sediment retention, water yield) to serve as inputs for ROOT’s optimisation (though ROOT could accept data from any suitable raster-based model).","Optimised spatial allocation maps; Agreement maps [robustness]; Millions of hectares influenced by restoration interventions (Myanmar)","No","Yes: Climate risks and mitigation are explicit drivers, with Myanmar using a disaster risk reduction objective and Costa Rica linking restoration to national mitigation planning through carbon sequestration modelling, demonstrated in outputs that include risk-reduction prioritization and carbon- benefit considerations.","Yes: The OUTPUT analysis incorporates economic aspects by optimizing under monetary constraints and performing comparative cost analyses, with outputs showing cost reductions (e.g., 13–95% lower costs for multi-service approaches in Colombia) and explicit cost-effectiveness gains, thereby linking NbS prioritisation to economic efficiency and monetized trade-offs.","Sub-national: Brazil;Malawi;Myanmar;Colombia;Costa Rica","Forest landscape restoration (a nature-based solution) was the NbS addressed, aiming to deliver carbon sequestration, sediment retention, water yield regulation, agricultural productivity, fuelwood supply.

Report on the tropics: China* 

---

## 1. Context and Rationale

The report addressed the global challenge of large-scale forest degradation and deforestation within tropical and subtropical biomes, where forests store high carbon stocks and harbour approximately 80% of terrestrial biodiversity . It situated the intervention within the policy architecture of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), particularly the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and emerging post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The underlying problem was not only ecological loss but also the limited specificity and quantitative grounding of national restoration targets.

The document argued that many countries lacked capacity for spatially explicit, quantitative prioritisation of restoration opportunities. This gap created risks of inefficient allocation of restoration investments and insufficient integration of biodiversity and climate objectives. The platform was therefore developed to provide an evidence-based, optimisation-driven decision support tool capable of guiding national-scale restoration planning in tropical forest ecosystems .

The rationale was explicitly economic and ecological: restoration should maximise biodiversity conservation and climate mitigation benefits while minimising opportunity and establishment costs. The platform aimed to operationalise restoration as an optimisation problem rather than a political or aspirational commitment.

---

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The platform’s stated objective was to identify priority areas for forest restoration that maximise biodiversity and climate mitigation benefits relative to costs . It was designed to answer five planning questions, including where to restore, what benefits and costs are expected, how trade-offs affect priorities, and how much land to restore .

The decision context was national-scale planning for developing countries Party to the CBD. In the China case study, restoration targets of 10–50% of available deforested lands were evaluated . The analysis was therefore intended to inform strategic investment planning and policy formulation rather than site-level implementation.

Importantly, the tool explicitly differentiated between cost-effective scenarios (maximising benefit per unit cost), maximum-benefit scenarios (ignoring cost), minimum-cost scenarios, and random allocations . This comparative design clarified the trade-offs inherent in restoration decisions and framed optimisation as a normative choice.

---

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The intervention strategy focused on forest ecosystem restoration across tropical and subtropical biomes within ±25° latitude . Restoration was framed as a nature-based solution delivering climate change mitigation (carbon sequestration) and biodiversity conservation (reduction in extinction risk).

Two restoration modalities were considered: active regeneration and natural regeneration, with establishment costs reflecting these pathways . The model assumed that biodiversity and climate benefits of active and natural regeneration were equivalent, although this was acknowledged as a simplification .

Conceptually, restoration was positioned as a cost-effective climate mitigation and conservation strategy. Poverty alleviation and livelihood considerations were mentioned at the platform level, but not analytically integrated into the optimisation objective.

---

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

### Geographic Scope and Scale

The analysis was conducted at national scale, using 1 km² planning units . For China, 64 million hectares fell within the WePlan domain, with 10.9 million hectares deemed available for restoration .

### Unit of Analysis

Planning units were 1 km² grid cells. The proportion of each cell available for restoration (xi ≤ ui) was constrained by land cover suitability derived from Copernicus 2019 land cover classes .

### Optimisation Logic

The restoration problem was formulated as a linear programming optimisation . The objective function maximised a weighted sum of climate mitigation benefits (carbon sequestration per unit cost) and biodiversity conservation benefits (extinction risk reduction per unit cost), subject to an area constraint T.

Cost-effectiveness was represented by dividing benefits by the sum of opportunity and establishment costs (c + e). Relative weights (ws, wb) controlled the trade-off between climate and biodiversity objectives .

Trade-off curves were generated by varying weights across scenarios . Maximum-benefit formulations removed the cost denominator, while minimum-cost and random allocations served as reference baselines.

### Variable Selection and Combination

Biodiversity benefit was calculated as mean reduction in extinction risk across forest-associated species, based on a species–area relationship model (Thomas et al., 2004), with z = 0.25 . Species distribution models from the SPARC dataset (~103,000 species) informed habitat availability .

Carbon mitigation benefit was estimated as potential aboveground biomass sequestration derived from a Random Forest model of old-growth biomass .

Costs comprised establishment costs (empirical statistical model from 234 World Bank projects; R² = 0.46) and opportunity costs derived from gridded land rent estimates .

### Treatment of Uncertainty and Assumptions

Uncertainty in carbon sequestration was partially bounded through incorporation of AGB standard error maps . However, extinction risk modelling relied on fixed parameter assumptions (z = 0.25) and presettlement habitat reconstructions.

The definition of land available for restoration was acknowledged as subjective and sensitive to biome boundaries and classification errors . Climate change impacts on ecosystem transitions were recognised but not dynamically modelled.

---

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

Biophysical data included Copernicus land cover (2019), 100 m AGB maps (CCI), and species distribution models (SPARC). Environmental covariates for SDMs included WorldClim bioclimatic variables and SoilGrids soil parameters .

Economic data included gridded GDP (Kummu et al., 2018) for establishment cost modelling and MapSPAM/FAOSTAT-derived land rents for opportunity cost estimation .

The biodiversity dataset incorporated 9,394 forest-associated species in China . Species weighting balanced plants and animals to prevent taxonomic bias .

Data limitations included moderate explanatory power of cost models, coarse resolution (1 km), and uncertainties in defining presettlement habitat distributions.

---

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

Outputs included:

* National-scale priority maps (cyan-highlighted restoration cells) for each target level .
* Trade-off plots showing climate–biodiversity benefit curves (e.g., Figure 3) .
* Scenario tables reporting carbon sequestration (Gt), extinction risk reduction (%), and cost (USD) for each target and objective combination .

For example, at 50% restoration under cost-effective balanced solutions, China could achieve 112.3 Gt carbon sequestration and 7.6% mean extinction risk reduction at a cost of ~43.7 billion USD .

Outputs were comparative and scenario-based, enabling evaluation of marginal returns as restoration area increased.

---

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate mitigation was directly integrated as an objective via carbon sequestration modelling . However, future climate scenarios were not incorporated into species distribution or biomass projections.

Climate change was acknowledged as influencing biome transitions and restoration suitability, but this was not modelled dynamically . Risk was framed primarily as extinction risk reduction and opportunity cost exposure rather than hazard mitigation.

---

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic analysis was central to the optimisation framework. Establishment costs were empirically derived from restoration project data, incorporating GDP, regeneration type, and scale effects . Opportunity costs were discounted at 5% to calculate perpetual land rent loss .

The analysis adopted a societal cost perspective and did not incorporate land tenure, livelihood displacement, or governance constraints . Implementation feasibility beyond cost was not modelled spatially.

---

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

The report acknowledged several limitations: subjective restoration availability definitions, equivalence assumption between natural and active regeneration, lack of temporal dynamics, and omission of land tenure and livelihood impacts .

Spatial concentration of restoration (land-sparing bias) was noted as a structural outcome of the optimisation, without constraints on spatial dispersion .

No empirical validation of predicted biodiversity or carbon gains was reported.

---

## 10. Critical Assessment

Methodologically, WePlan – Forests demonstrated strong analytical rigor through explicit linear programming formulation and integration of biodiversity, climate, and cost metrics . Its transparency in presenting trade-offs and alternative reference scenarios enhanced decision clarity. However, robustness was constrained by static modelling assumptions, particularly regarding climate change, species–area dynamics, and equivalence of restoration modalities. The societal cost perspective omitted governance and equity dimensions, limiting policy realism. The spatial resolution (1 km) and presettlement habitat reconstructions introduced uncertainty in biodiversity benefit estimates. Nonetheless, the framework was scalable, replicable, and adaptable to national contexts, representing a sophisticated optimisation-based NbS planning tool with clear strengths in cost-effectiveness analysis but limitations in socio-ecological integration.","active regeneration; natural regeneration","Land cover suitability (Copernicus 2019 land cover classes)","1 km x 1 km grid cells","1 km² grid-based planning units constrained by Copernicus 2019 land-cover suitability, with a linear-programming optimization maximizing a weighted, cost-normalized sum of carbon sequestration and extinction-risk reduction under an area constraint.","Not adressed in paper","WePlan – Forests (This study)","WePlan – Forests : An optimisation-based decision-support platform for national-scale spatial planning of forest restoration in tropical/subtropical biomes; it identifies priority restoration areas by maximizing a weighted sum of climate (carbon sequestration) and biodiversity (extinction risk reduction) benefits per unit cost across 1 km² planning units, under land suitability constraints, and outputs priority maps, trade-off plots, and scenario tables to guide strategic investment planning and policy formulation rather than site-level implementation.","National-scale priority maps (cyan-highlighted restoration cells) for each restoration target level","No","Yes: NbS (forest restoration) is spatially targeted to maximize climate mitigation benefits by prioritising areas with highest potential carbon sequestration, and the authors demonstrate this through scenario-based prioritisation and outputs such as national-scale priority maps and tables of estimated carbon sequestration across scenarios.","Yes: The OUTPUT analysis includes economic metrics such as costs (establishment costs and opportunity costs in USD, e.g., ~43.7 billion USD for a target), cost-effectiveness (benefits per unit cost), and scenario comparisons (cost-effective vs maximum-benefit vs minimum-cost) embedded in the optimisation outputs, with a societal cost perspective and discounting of opportunity costs at 5%, alongside outputs on carbon sequestration and extinction-risk reduction for each target.","National: China","NbS addressed: forest ecosystem restoration across tropical and subtropical biomes within ±25° latitude, framed as a nature-based solution delivering climate mitigation (carbon sequestration) and biodiversity conservation.

Context and Rationale

The document was produced to operationalise Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) commitments across the Mano River Union (MRU) transboundary landscapes (Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone) within a GEF-funded project on ecosystem conservation and international water resources management . It framed the central problem as the need to translate high-level restoration pledges into implementable, context-appropriate interventions that could address the drivers of deforestation and degradation while generating tangible co-benefits for people, biodiversity, and climate .

The rationale was explicitly governance- and planning-oriented: MRU landscapes comprised linked mosaics of forest use, agriculture, and settlements, and the report argued that comprehensive cross-sector policies were necessary to manage these interdependencies at transboundary scale . FLR was presented as a “forward-looking and dynamic approach” that strengthened landscape resilience and created future options under evolving societal needs and emerging challenges . Importantly, the report asserted that geospatial assessment alone was insufficient to prescribe interventions; it emphasised the need to integrate landscape-scale spatial analysis with national expertise, local knowledge, and site-level verification to avoid mis-specification of interventions and to ensure implementability .

---

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The document’s objective was not to conduct a de novo restoration opportunities assessment, but to provide guidance on priority FLR interventions for MRU transboundary landscapes by building on ROAM applications conducted by national committees and consultants and on a transboundary spatial multi-criteria analysis (SMCA) . It aimed to support decisions about “where, when, how and with whom” to implement FLR, explicitly positioning intervention selection as the key step in moving from political commitments to action .

The decision context combined national commitments and transboundary prioritisation. The report referenced Bonn Challenge pledges by MRU countries (e.g., Liberia 1 million ha; Guinea 2 million ha; Côte d’Ivoire 5 million ha by 2030) and contrasted these with the MRU transboundary ROAM identification of ~250,000 ha of FLR opportunity areas—presented as only 3.2% of the total pledged restoration area, but strategically significant because it concentrated on high conservation value, biodiversity-rich transboundary forests and livelihood-linked buffer landscapes . Thus, the intended decisions were strategic targeting and intervention programming in priority transboundary landscapes rather than national-scale allocation of the full Bonn Challenge commitment.

---

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The report framed FLR as a “fit-for-purpose Nature-based Solution,” defined as a long-term process of regaining ecosystem functionality and enhancing human well-being across degraded and deforested landscapes, operating at landscape (watershed/jurisdiction/biome) scale and explicitly “more than just planting trees” . Conceptually, interventions were required to restore multiple functions for multiple benefits, be tailored to local context using diverse approaches and knowledge systems, and be managed adaptively for long-term resilience . It also stated that FLR should not convert or destroy natural forests and should engage stakeholders through participatory governance .

Interventions were classified into three land-use types—forest lands, agricultural lands, and protective/buffer lands—each associated with restoration “option categories” (Table 1, p. 5): planted forests/woodlots, natural regeneration, silviculture enhancement, agroforestry, improved fallow, and watershed protection/erosion control . The MRU-specific typology derived from national activity reports condensed interventions into five proposed actions: assisted natural regeneration (ANR) of degraded natural forest; agroforestry systems combining cash crops with indigenous shade/timber trees; “sedentarization” of smallholder agriculture using indigenous/fast-growing species with crops; woodlots for fuelwood; and commodity plantations . The report was explicit that woodlots and pure commodity plantations, when implemented in isolation, could not be considered FLR because exotic monocultures did not restore biodiversity and ecological function, although exotics could play a transitional role in broader landscape strategies .

---

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

The spatial and analytical framework was built around ROAM processes implemented nationally and a transboundary ROAM SMCA that identified and “measured” FLR opportunities at landscape level . The geographic focus was four priority transboundary landscapes, analysed through 5 km buffer zones around protected/conserved areas (figures for Diecke–Nimba, Gola–Liberia, Gola–Sierra Leone, Wonegizi–Ziama) . The unit of analysis in mapping outputs was not a grid cell but spatially delineated opportunity areas within these buffers, classified into priority categories and linked to intervention types through a harmonisation process.

The key methodological step in this report was the “harmonisation” of SMCA-derived opportunity classes with the intervention categories identified in national activity reports (Section 3.1). The report acknowledged that global-scale datasets (e.g., rainfall erosivity) and simple thresholds (e.g., defining sloping land as >5 degrees) were used to delineate opportunity areas, but that these factors could not reliably locate site-level conditions. It therefore combined multiple SMCA factors into simplified classes before allocating an intervention type, explicitly describing this as a “simplifying mechanism” that recognised the insufficiency of data alone to recommend between interventions such as agroforestry versus ANR without local validation .

Prioritisation logic was expressed through ranked “priority” classes tied to land attributes such as degraded forest on steep slopes (allocated to passive natural regeneration as “ecological hills”), degraded forest/fallow (allocated to agroforestry or ANR), and cultivated land (allocated to sedentarised cultivation/woodlots/commodity plantations, with the report highlighting that some of these latter options were non-FLR) . The framework therefore functioned less as a quantitative optimisation and more as a rule-based mapping and decision tree that used land cover and terrain attributes to propose intervention families. Treatment of uncertainty was qualitative: it was acknowledged through explicit warnings about data insufficiency and the need for site verification, rather than by formal sensitivity analysis or probabilistic modelling .

---

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The report relied on three evidence streams: (i) national ROAM activity reports based on local knowledge and field visits; (ii) the transboundary ROAM SMCA using “best available spatial data”; and (iii) land cover maps derived from ESA Sentinel-2 10 m imagery used to compile buffer-zone opportunity maps (figures in Section 3) . It also referenced use of global datasets such as rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility, and slope thresholds (>5 degrees) to delineate interventions, explicitly cautioning that these inputs were too coarse or indirect to prescribe site-level actions .

Data limitations were therefore central to the report’s logic. The authors argued that certain criteria (e.g., erosivity/erodibility) could not be precisely located at site scale and that the SMCA results needed national expert verification and local stakeholder inputs to ensure alignment with site conditions such as soil moisture/nutrients and seed source availability .

---

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

The primary decision products were (i) a typology and guidance on priority interventions; (ii) simplified spatial opportunity maps for each transboundary landscape’s 5 km buffer (Figures 3–6); and (iii) tabulated area estimates of priority classes and assigned intervention types (Tables 3–6) . The maps showed a ranked set of opportunity classes (e.g., “Priority 1 passive NR / ecological hills,” “Priority 2 agroforestry/ANR,” etc.) and were explicitly presented as harmonised outputs rather than prescriptive site plans .

Quantified outputs were limited to area (hectares) by priority/intervention category within each landscape. For example, Diecke–Nimba totals were reported as 93,119 ha across four priority classes (including 14,331 ha for passive natural regeneration on steep degraded forest and 54,129 ha for sedentarised cultivation on cultivated land) . Gola–Liberia totals were 6,205 ha across prioritised actions combining mining debris rehabilitation and agroforestry/ANR allocations . Gola–Sierra Leone totals were 49,150 ha with large areas allocated to agroforestry/ANR in degraded forest and agroforestry/sedentary agriculture in fallow land . Wonegizi–Ziama totals were 76,682 ha, dominated by agroforestry/ANR allocations for degraded forest/fallow .

No quantified impacts were reported for carbon, biodiversity gains, livelihoods, or hydrological regulation. Decision relevance was therefore achieved through spatial targeting and intervention matching rather than impact forecasting.

---

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was integrated primarily through conceptual framing rather than explicit modelling. FLR was stated to contribute to nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement and to provide mitigation and adaptation benefits, including disaster risk reduction . At the intervention level, ANR was described as supporting carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation at low cost , and riparian corridors were described as providing hydrological regulation, filtration, riverbank stabilisation, and mitigation co-benefits .

Hazard and risk considerations were operationalised indirectly via protective/buffer land interventions (riparian buffers, erosion control on steep slopes) and via the SMCA’s use of slope and erosion-related criteria . Future climate scenarios, downscaled climate projections, or dynamic hazard modelling were not addressed in the document.

---

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

The report treated cost considerations qualitatively. ANR was explicitly characterised as “low-cost, low-tech and high-impact” , and woodlots/fast-growing exotics were framed as potentially offsetting restoration costs if harvested gradually within a broader strategy . However, no cost-effectiveness, ROI, NPV, or financing calculations were provided. Financing mechanisms were mentioned only at a high level through calls to “unlock existing and leverage additional funds” .

Implementation logic was more developed than economic analysis. The report repeatedly insisted that SMCA outputs required verification by national expertise and alignment with site-level conditions, and that intervention selection must be rooted in local community needs through stakeholder-driven processes . It recommended village-level participatory land-use plans for agroforestry, including agreements on timber harvesting rules, NTFP access, and responsibilities . It also proposed village tree nurseries as a central delivery mechanism for scaling agroforestry and indigenous seedling propagation, advocating a network of nurseries across buffer zones . Governance integration was further highlighted through calls for cross-sector policies and capacity building within government agencies and communities, as well as “gender responsive restoration” embedded in MRU development strategies .

---

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Validation and robustness were addressed through procedural safeguards rather than statistical testing. The report explicitly argued that spatial analyses should be verified by national expertise and linked to site conditions, and that participatory processes were required to refine ambiguous allocations (e.g., where agroforestry versus ANR could both apply) . It acknowledged that factors such as rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility were not reliably site-specific, and thus could not support precise prescriptions without local verification .

No sensitivity analysis, scenario testing, or quantitative model validation was reported. The principal limitations were therefore the coarse or indirect nature of some spatial inputs and the simplifications required to harmonise SMCA classes with intervention categories. The document also noted an implementation-relevant limitation: fine-scale spatial analyses would be required during agroforestry deployment and should be matched with updated protected-area management plan mapping .

---

## 10. Critical Assessment

The document’s methodological strength lay in its explicit recognition that spatial multi-criteria outputs are insufficient for intervention prescription without local verification, and in its attempt to formally harmonise landscape-scale opportunity mapping with locally grounded national activity report recommendations . Analytical transparency was moderate: intervention typologies and allocation rules (e.g., steep degraded forest to passive regeneration; degraded forest/fallow to agroforestry/ANR) were clearly communicated, but the underlying SMCA weighting and scoring mechanics were not documented in this report, limiting auditability of spatial priorities . Robustness was pursued procedurally through stakeholder-driven validation and site-level checks, yet the absence of formal uncertainty analysis means the maps could be misinterpreted as definitive rather than indicative. The intervention framing appropriately constrained non-FLR practices (woodlots/commodity plantations) by warning against treating them as FLR in isolation, but the continued inclusion of these options in priority classes risked conceptual slippage during implementation if safeguards were weak . Scalability was plausible because the approach relied on replicable typologies and remote-sensing-derived land cover, but transferability would depend heavily on the availability and quality of national activity reports and participatory governance capacity. Overall, the report functioned effectively as an implementation bridge document, but it did not provide impact quantification needed for investment-grade decision-making.","Natural regeneration; Assisted natural regeneration (ANR)","Rainfall erosivity (global-scale datasets); Soil erodibility (global-scale datasets); Slope (global-scale datasets); Land cover (ESA Sentinel-2 10 m imagery); Protected areas (not specified)","NA","ROAM-based spatial assessment (national and transboundary) using a transboundary ROAM SMCA to delineate opportunity areas within 5 km buffers around protected areas, followed by a harmonisation with national intervention typologies via a rule-based classification to assign priority categories.","Procedural safeguards; verification by national expertise; site-level checks; participatory processes with local stakeholders (stakeholder validation)","NA","NA","Simplified spatial opportunity maps (four transboundary landscapes within 5 km buffers) with ranked priority classes [Priority 1 passive natural regeneration / ecological hills; Priority 2 agroforestry / ANR; Priority 3 sedentarised cultivation / woodlots; Priority 4 commodity plantations]; Area/priority by landscape (ha): Diecke–Nimba 93,119 ha total across four priority classes (14,331 ha passive natural regeneration on steep degraded forest; 54,129 ha sedentarised cultivation on cultivated land); Gola–Liberia 6,205 ha total across mining debris rehabilitation and agroforestry/ANR allocations; Gola–Sierra Leone 49,150 ha total (agroforestry/ANR in degraded forest and agroforestry/sedentary agriculture in fallow); Wonegizi–Ziama 76,682 ha total (agroforestry/ANR in degraded forest/fallow).","No","No","No","Multi-country: Côte d’Ivoire;Guinea;Liberia;Sierra Leone","Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) was addressed as the NbS across the Mano River Union (MRU) landscapes.

---

## 1. Context and Rationale

The document was developed in response to the rapid proliferation of corporate “No Deforestation” commitments across tropical commodity supply chains. It identified a central operational gap: while companies had committed to protecting High Conservation Value (HCV) areas, secondary and regenerating forests with significant carbon stocks and biodiversity values were often excluded from protection because existing forest definitions were either too narrow (HCV-only) or too broad and impractical for field implementation .

The report framed tropical deforestation as both a biodiversity and climate crisis, emphasising that secondary forests provide essential carbon storage and ecological functions but were not systematically protected under prevailing certification systems . The High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach was presented as the first “practical, field-tested methodology” capable of distinguishing forest areas requiring protection from degraded lands suitable for development .

The rationale therefore centred on resolving a land-use planning dilemma: how to reconcile agricultural expansion with forest conservation in fragmented tropical landscapes, particularly in palm oil and pulp-and-paper sectors, without relying solely on absolute carbon thresholds . The document positioned HCS as a pragmatic integration of conservation science, carbon accounting, and social safeguards within operational land-use planning.

---

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The primary objective of the HCS Approach was to operationalise No Deforestation commitments through a structured methodology capable of producing an Integrated Conservation and Land Use Plan (ICLUP) . The toolkit was intended for specialist practitioners engaged in plantation or agribusiness development, providing technical guidance for classifying forest vegetation, analysing forest patches, and integrating social safeguards and conservation values .

The decision context was primarily project-level land allocation within concession areas in humid tropical landscapes. The method was designed to guide whether specific areas within a development footprint should be conserved or may be developed, subject to Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) and HCV considerations .

Importantly, the toolkit acknowledged retrofitting requirements for developments already underway and emphasised moratoria on land clearance during assessment phases . It therefore served as both a planning and compliance instrument within voluntary sustainability frameworks.

---

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The HCS Approach conceptualised forest conservation itself as the core nature-based solution, embedded within integrated land-use planning. It defined HCS forest not through fixed carbon thresholds but via vegetation structure, biomass levels, and field-calibrated classification into strata: High Density Forest (HDF), Medium Density Forest (MDF), Low Density Forest (LDF), Young Regenerating Forest (YRF), Scrub (S), and Open Land (OL) .

The strategy rested on a threshold separating viable forest (HCS) from degraded lands eligible for development. This structural approach was justified as a proxy for carbon storage and biodiversity co-benefits .

NbS framing was implicit rather than rhetorical: conserving HCS forest aimed to maintain carbon stocks, biodiversity habitat, and ecosystem services while enabling limited development on degraded lands. The methodology also embedded participatory governance and FPIC as integral safeguards, treating social consent as foundational rather than ancillary .

---

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

### Scale and Unit of Analysis

The methodology operated at concession or development-area scale within tropical landscapes. The unit of analysis was spatially explicit vegetation patches derived from satellite and LiDAR classification, refined through field inventory plots .

### Phase 1: Vegetation Stratification

Vegetation classification combined remote sensing (satellite imagery and optional full-coverage or transect LiDAR) with field sampling to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) and refine vegetation classes . Three methodological options were described: full LiDAR AGB modelling (most accurate), LiDAR transects plus satellite classification (intermediate), and satellite plus forest inventory only (least precise) .

A high-resolution satellite-based land cover classification with ground-truthing was mandatory in all cases. Output was an indicative HCS forest map with average carbon values per vegetation class .

### Phase 2: Patch Analysis

Forest patches were analysed using a structured Decision Tree (Figure 4) integrating patch core area size, connectivity within 200 m, risk assessment, and biodiversity significance . Thresholds included 100 ha core area for high-priority patches and 10 ha for medium/low priority categorisation .

The Decision Tree incorporated a “give and take” principle allowing exchange of medium/low priority patches to consolidate and simplify high-priority conservation areas . Rapid Biodiversity Assessments (RBA) could refine patch classification where needed.

### Phase 3: Integration

Patch outputs were integrated with HCV areas, peatlands, riparian zones, and community land-use mapping to produce an ICLUP .

### Treatment of Uncertainty

The document acknowledged varying accuracy levels among remote-sensing options and emphasised practitioner judgement and field calibration. However, no formal probabilistic uncertainty propagation was specified. Uncertainty was managed procedurally through peer review and quality assurance processes .

---

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

Data sources included satellite imagery, LiDAR datasets, field inventory plots, and participatory mapping outputs . Carbon estimation relied on AGB modelling derived from LiDAR calibration plots or inventory sampling .

Social and tenure data were gathered through participatory mapping and FPIC processes . Biodiversity inputs were incorporated via HCV assessments and Rapid Biodiversity Assessments .

The methodology relied heavily on expert teams with multidisciplinary skills, reflecting high technical and institutional requirements .

---

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

Primary outputs included:

* Indicative HCS forest maps.
* Classified vegetation strata maps.
* HCS Patch Analysis outputs identifying High Priority Patches (HPP), Medium (MPP), and Low (LPP).
* A proposed Integrated Conservation and Land Use Plan (ICLUP) .

The ICLUP delineated proposed conservation areas, community land-use zones, and development areas, serving as the final decision instrument .

Outputs were spatially explicit but did not quantify carbon emissions avoided or biodiversity metrics numerically within Module 1; rather, they informed binary conservation/development decisions.

---

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate mitigation was embedded through carbon stock estimation and forest classification but the document emphasised that the HCS Approach was “a pragmatic tool for land use planning rather than a carbon assessment” .

Carbon data were recognised as relevant for national GHG accounting and NDC reporting , but climate scenarios were not modelled. Risk was considered ecologically via fragmentation science (core area, connectivity, risk categories) and socially via tenure conflict mitigation through FPIC.

---

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic optimisation was not directly modelled. The methodology focused on compliance with No Deforestation commitments rather than cost-benefit analysis.

However, it acknowledged financing needs for conservation incentives and monitoring, and noted potential leverage of carbon finance or PES schemes .

Implementation considerations were highly developed: integration with HCV and FPIC, moratoria on land clearance, grievance mechanisms, participatory monitoring, and quality assurance review processes .

---

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Validation occurred through mandatory peer review and quality assurance mechanisms under the HCS Approach Secretariat . Transparency of maps and data was required, and practitioner accreditation systems were established .

Limitations were acknowledged in applying the methodology to High Forest Cover Landscapes (HFCLs), where standard patch-based thresholds might be inappropriate . Adaptation for smallholders and emerging issues remained under development .

The methodology depended heavily on data quality, expert judgement, and institutional capacity.

---

## 10. Critical Assessment

The HCS Approach represented a significant methodological advancement in translating No Deforestation commitments into operational land-use planning. Its integration of remote sensing, conservation science, FPIC, and patch-level decision rules provided a transparent and replicable framework . Analytical transparency was high in procedural terms but limited in quantitative justification of thresholds (e.g., 100 ha core area). Robustness relied on peer review rather than formal uncertainty analysis. The methodology appropriately prioritised social safeguards, reducing risks of conservation-related conflict. However, its project-scale focus limited integration with broader landscape or jurisdictional planning frameworks. Scalability depended on technical capacity and governance conditions. Overall, the HCS Approach functioned as a pragmatic compliance and conservation planning instrument with strong procedural safeguards but limited quantitative optimisation.","NA","Land cover classification (Satellite imagery with ground-truthing); LiDAR data (LiDAR datasets); Above-ground biomass (AGB) (LiDAR calibration plots or inventory sampling); Vegetation strata (HDF, MDF, LDF, YRF, S, OL) (Remote sensing and field sampling); HCS forest map (Derived from satellite and LiDAR classification; field calibration); HCV areas (HCV assessments); Peatlands (Peatland mapping); Riparian zones (Riparian zones mapping); Community land-use mapping (Participatory mapping outputs); Forest patches (Forest patches derived from satellite and LiDAR classification; field inventory plots); Rapid Biodiversity Assessments (RBA) (Rapid Biodiversity Assessments); Biodiversity significance (Biodiversity significance layer) (HCV assessments; RBA)","NA","Vegetation stratification by combining remote-sensing (high-resolution satellite imagery) with LiDAR and field plots to map HCS forest and estimate biomass; Patch analysis via a structured decision tree using core-area size, 200 m connectivity, risk, and biodiversity significance to classify patches as high/medium/low priority; Integration of patches with HCV, peatlands, riparian zones and community land-use to produce the ICLUP.","Mandatory peer review and quality assurance mechanisms; Transparency of maps and data; Practitioner accreditation systems","NA","NA","Indicative HCS forest maps; Classified vegetation strata maps; HCS Patch Analysis outputs identifying High Priority Patches (HPP), Medium Priority Patches (MPP), and Low Priority Patches (LPP); Integrated Conservation and Land Use Plan (ICLUP) delineating proposed conservation areas, community land-use zones, and development areas","No","No","Yes: Economic aspects are acknowledged (financing needs, potential carbon finance and payments for ecosystem services) but economic optimisation is not modelled and the outputs do not include economic metrics (no cost-benefit, ROI, NPV) and remain spatial/decision-oriented (HCS maps, ICLUP).","NA","The NbS addressed was forest conservation through the High Carbon Stock (HCS) Approach embedded in an Integrated Conservation and Land Use Plan (ICLUP) to operationalize No Deforestation commitments in tropical concessions.

Chazdon, R.L. and Guariguata, M.R. (2018). *Decision support tools for forest landscape restoration: Current status and future outlook.* CIFOR Occasional Paper 183 

---

## 1. Context and Rationale

The document addressed the global challenge of large-scale forest degradation and deforestation in mixed-use landscapes, particularly in tropical regions. It was framed within the policy momentum generated by international commitments such as the Bonn Challenge and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which collectively aimed to restore hundreds of millions of hectares of degraded land. The authors positioned forest landscape restoration (FLR) not as an ecological end in itself but as a means to address intertwined socioecological challenges, including biodiversity loss, land degradation, climate change mitigation and adaptation, water insecurity, and rural poverty.

The rationale for the report rested on the observation that restoration commitments were proliferating, yet the technical and institutional capacity to translate these commitments into effective spatially explicit action remained uneven and fragmented. Many restoration efforts had historically failed due to poor planning, weak governance, inadequate species selection, and insufficient stakeholder engagement. The authors therefore argued that decision support tools were essential to operationalize FLR principles, align objectives with local contexts, and allocate limited resources efficiently.

---

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The primary objective of the report was to review and synthesize existing decision support tools relevant to FLR, assess their strengths and limitations, and identify gaps requiring further development . The review targeted tools used at various stages of the FLR process: readiness assessment, opportunity mapping, ecosystem service modeling, biodiversity integration, cost-effectiveness analysis, spatial prioritization, and species selection.

The decision context emphasized multi-level governance. Tools were intended to support national and sub-national restoration planning, investment prioritization, and policy alignment, rather than fine-scale operational site design. The document explicitly linked decision support to investment planning, restoration opportunity assessment, ecosystem service valuation, biodiversity targeting, and trade-off analysis. It highlighted the need to guide decisions about where to restore, how to restore, and which interventions to prioritize under budgetary constraints.

---

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

FLR was conceptualized as a landscape-scale, multi-objective Nature-based Solution integrating ecological restoration with livelihood enhancement . Interventions were categorized across a gradient of intensity and land-use types:

* Natural regeneration (spontaneous, assisted, farmer-managed)
* Agroforestry systems (e.g., silvopastoral systems, shade-grown crops)
* Mixed-species plantings
* Commercial woodlots and plantations (when aligned with FLR principles)
* Watershed protection forests
* Corridor restoration for biodiversity connectivity

These interventions were framed as mechanisms to restore ecological integrity while delivering ecosystem services and socioeconomic benefits. The authors emphasized that interventions varied in cost, trajectory, risk profile, and distribution of benefits. Restoration was treated as an adaptive, long-term socioecological process rather than a one-off technical intervention.

---

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

### Spatial Scale and Units

Most tools reviewed operated at national or sub-national scales, although some spatial prioritization tools could be applied at landscape or watershed levels. Units of analysis varied depending on the tool and data availability, including grid cells, administrative boundaries, watersheds, and land parcels.

### Modeling and Prioritization Logic

The analytical logic across tools typically followed a structured progression:

1. **Readiness and enabling conditions assessment** (e.g., Restoration Diagnostic).
2. **Opportunity mapping** (e.g., ROAM), combining biophysical degradation indicators and socio-political feasibility.
3. **Ecosystem service modeling**, often via production functions (e.g., InVEST), to estimate potential service supply under restoration scenarios.
4. **Optimization and spatial prioritization**, using linear programming or efficiency frontiers to identify trade-offs among objectives.
5. **Cost and cost-effectiveness analysis**, integrating implementation and opportunity costs.

Multi-criteria spatial prioritization models combined spatial layers representing carbon storage potential, biodiversity value, water regulation, erosion risk, feasibility proxies (e.g., land cost), and socio-economic priorities. Weighting schemes allowed scenario testing, enabling stakeholders to visualize alternative trade-offs.

Efficiency frontiers were used to depict trade-offs between ecosystem services, identifying Pareto-efficient restoration allocations. Some tools incorporated probabilistic modeling (e.g., ARIES), while others relied on deterministic production functions (e.g., InVEST).

### Assumptions and Uncertainty

The treatment of uncertainty varied. ARIES explicitly incorporated probabilistic approaches and uncertainty quantification, whereas many tools relied on deterministic models without systematic uncertainty propagation. Temporal dynamics were often insufficiently addressed; most models estimated potential service supply rather than recovery trajectories.

---

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The modeling frameworks relied on diverse spatial datasets:

* Biophysical: land cover, soil types, slope, climate, carbon stocks, hydrological data.
* Biodiversity: species distributions, habitat suitability, forest cover thresholds.
* Socioeconomic: land tenure, agricultural profitability, land value, livelihood indicators.
* Cost proxies: land rental value, natural regeneration potential.

The report acknowledged substantial data constraints in many countries. Where spatial data were lacking, expert knowledge mapping was recommended. Economic valuation frequently relied on benefit transfer methods, introducing context-dependent uncertainties.

---

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

Outputs included:

* Restoration opportunity maps delineating intervention types.
* Carbon accrual curves and abatement cost curves.
* Multi-layer priority maps for food security, biodiversity, and climate resilience.
* Efficiency frontiers illustrating ecosystem service trade-offs.
* Cost–benefit analyses and ROI estimates.

These outputs were explicitly intended to inform national investment planning, policy prioritization, financing strategies, and stakeholder negotiation processes. Spatial outputs were typically presented as categorical priority classes or continuous suitability indices.

---

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was integrated primarily through carbon sequestration metrics and mitigation potential . Carbon storage was frequently used as a co-benefit optimization criterion. Some tools incorporated climate resilience considerations in species selection or restoration design.

However, climate change was not deeply embedded through dynamic future climate scenario modeling in most tools. Adaptation was framed conceptually (e.g., resilience to disturbances), but analytical integration of climate projections remained limited. Risk framing focused more on fire risk, erosion, and degradation trajectories than on explicit climate hazard modeling.

---

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic analysis included:

* Direct implementation costs.
* Opportunity costs (often proxied by agricultural land value).
* Ecosystem service valuation.
* Cost-effectiveness analysis.
* Return on investment calculations.

Financing mechanisms discussed included public funding, private investment, carbon markets, restoration bonds, and blended finance. However, standardized tools for financial modeling and scaling were underdeveloped.

Implementation considerations included stakeholder engagement (e.g., FPIC), governance alignment, institutional coordination, and adaptive management. Social mapping tools were emerging but less mature than biophysical models.

---

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Validation was uneven across tools. InVEST had undergone more empirical evaluation than many alternatives. Habitat quality models lacked consistent validation across contexts. Economic valuations were case-specific and dependent on benefit transfer assumptions.

The authors explicitly acknowledged gaps:

* Limited tools for landscape-scale implementation guidance.
* Weak integration of socioeconomic outcomes.
* Insufficient monitoring and adaptive management frameworks.
* Limited incorporation of temporal dynamics and uncertainty.
* Overemphasis on opportunity assessment rather than operational deployment.

---

## 10. Critical Assessment

Methodologically, the report provided a rigorous synthesis of a rapidly evolving field and clearly articulated the logical structure of decision support in FLR. Its strength lay in integrating ecological modeling, economic analysis, and spatial optimization within a coherent planning framework.

However, analytical transparency varied across reviewed tools, particularly regarding uncertainty treatment and temporal assumptions. Many models estimated potential rather than realized ecosystem service recovery, potentially overstating short-term benefits. Socioeconomic integration remained comparatively underdeveloped, and governance complexity was treated descriptively rather than analytically.

The conclusions were robust in identifying gaps but somewhat optimistic regarding tool transferability across heterogeneous socio-political contexts. Scalability was conceptually addressed, yet operationalization at local landscape scales remained insufficiently supported by concrete methodologies.

Overall, the document constituted a technically sound and policy-relevant synthesis, but it also revealed that FLR decision support remained stronger in spatial assessment and modeling than in implementation design, adaptive governance, and long-term socioecological monitoring.","Natural regeneration; Silvopastoral systems; Shade-grown crops; Mixed-species plantings; Commercial woodlots and plantations (when aligned with FLR principles); Watershed protection forests; Corridor restoration for biodiversity connectivity","Carbon storage potential (Biophysical data); Carbon stocks (Biophysical data); Land cover (Biophysical data); Soil types (Biophysical data); Slope (Biophysical data); Climate (Biophysical data); Hydrological data (Biophysical data); Erosion risk (Biophysical data); Water regulation (Ecosystem services data); Species distributions (Biodiversity data); Habitat suitability (Biodiversity data); Forest cover thresholds (Biodiversity data); Biodiversity value (Biodiversity data); Land tenure (Socioeconomic data); Agricultural profitability (Socioeconomic data); Land value (Socioeconomic data); Livelihood indicators (Socioeconomic data); Feasibility proxies (Cost proxies); Land rental value (Cost proxies); Natural regeneration potential (Cost proxies)","NA","Multi-criteria spatial prioritization using weighted overlays of biophysical and socio-economic layers (e.g., carbon storage, biodiversity value, water regulation, erosion risk, feasibility proxies like land cost) with optimization (linear programming or efficiency frontiers) to produce priority/suitability maps.","Empirical evaluation of InVEST; lack of consistent validation for habitat quality models; validation overall uneven across tools.","InVEST (https://naturalcapitalproject.org/invest/); ARIES (https://aries.msi.ucdavis.edu/); ROAM (https://www.nature.org/content/dam/nature/en_US/documents/roam-methodology.pdf); Restoration Diagnostic (https://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/occasional_papers/OP183.pdf)","InVEST: ecosystem service modeling via production functions to estimate potential service supply under restoration scenarios; ARIES: probabilistic modeling with uncertainty quantification to assess ecosystem service outcomes and trade-offs; ROAM: opportunity mapping combining biophysical degradation indicators and socio-political feasibility to identify restoration opportunities; Restoration Diagnostic: readiness and enabling conditions assessment to evaluate preparedness for restoration.","Restoration opportunity maps delineating intervention types (natural regeneration; agroforestry systems; mixed-species plantings; commercial woodlots/plantations; watershed protection forests; corridor restoration); Multi-layer priority maps (food security, biodiversity, climate resilience)","No","Yes: the authors explicitly target NbS restoration to deliver climate mitigation and adaptation benefits by prioritizing areas with high carbon storage potential and climate resilience, and they demonstrate this in outputs such as carbon accrual/abatement curves and multi-layer climate-resilience priority maps used to guide investment and restoration prioritization.","Yes: Economic outputs are included—the outputs feature cost-benefit analyses and ROI estimates, plus cost-effectiveness analyses, backed by direct implementation and opportunity costs and ecosystem service valuation, with financing mechanisms (public/private funding, carbon markets, blended finance) discussed, and these outputs inform national investment planning and policy prioritization, i.e., economic valuation and trade-offs are integrated into the outputs.","Global: worldwide","The NbS addressed was FLR, a Nature-based Solution integrating ecological restoration with livelihoods.

**Prodromou, M. (2025). Green-HIT WP6, Deliverable D6.3: Afforestation/Reforestation Recommendation Module (Prototype, Report)** 

---

## 1. Context and Rationale

The deliverable was developed under the Green-HIT project as part of a broader “Holistic IoT platform for Forest Management and Monitoring.” It responded to two interrelated environmental management challenges in Cyprus: (i) detecting and monitoring deforestation, and (ii) prioritizing post-fire reforestation and afforestation interventions using spatial intelligence. The document explicitly linked deforestation to global biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, and EU climate targets, and highlighted Mediterranean forest vulnerability trends .

The rationale for the intervention was technological and operational. The authors argued that remote sensing and GIS provide scalable, objective, and cost-effective monitoring compared to manual or purely ground-based methods. In particular, change detection using Sentinel-2 imagery was framed as a practical alternative to supervised machine learning and dense time-series models, which were considered computationally demanding and data-intensive for operational deployment .

The second rationale concerned post-fire restoration complexity. Reforestation planning was presented as a multi-criteria decision problem requiring integration of topographic, climatic, ecological, and disturbance-related factors. Spatial Multi-Criteria Analysis (SMCA) using AHP was therefore adopted to structure this complexity into a transparent prioritization framework .

---

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The deliverable had two core objectives:

1. To develop a deforestation detection module capable of identifying forest loss using change detection techniques.
2. To develop a reforestation/afforestation recommendation module capable of prioritizing areas for restoration after fire events using a spatial multi-criteria decision model .

The decision context was national forest management in Cyprus, specifically supporting the Department of Forests (DoF). The reforestation module was designed to guide authorities by distinguishing areas likely to regenerate naturally from those requiring artificial restoration actions .

Importantly, the tool was framed explicitly as a decision-support instrument rather than a prescriptive model. The document acknowledged that political, financial, and logistical constraints may override model outputs in practice .

---

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The intervention strategy centered on post-fire ecological restoration. Reforestation was defined as natural regeneration and/or artificial planting after wildfire, aimed at restoring ecosystem structure, biodiversity, soil stability, and carbon sequestration .

The NbS framing was implicit but evident. The model differentiated between:

* Areas suitable for natural regeneration (low/medium priority), and
* Areas requiring artificial restoration (high priority), including actions such as spot sowing, broadhand seeding, planting, terraces, and coppicing .

Thus, restoration was conceptualized as a spectrum of intervention intensity, guided by ecological condition (e.g., burn severity, tree density). However, alternative NbS scenarios (e.g., mixed-species planting versus assisted regeneration) were not modeled comparatively; rather, prioritization preceded method selection.

---

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

### Geographic Scope and Unit of Analysis

The model was developed and tested in Cyprus, specifically on the Solea and Argaka fire events. The spatial unit was raster-based, driven by input datasets (10–30 m resolution for most layers, up to 1 km for temperature) .

The system was implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE), enabling large-scale cloud processing and interactive analysis .

---

### A. Deforestation Module

The change detection workflow used pixel-based Euclidean Distance (ED) across spectral bands and derived vegetation/burn indices from Sentinel-2 imagery.

The ED was computed as:

ED = √∑(X_ref − X_target)²

where X included normalized spectral bands and indices .

Automatic thresholding was applied using Otsu’s method to classify pixels into change/no-change classes .

Ancillary layers (Copernicus land cover, MODIS burned area) were used to categorize changes as forest loss, agricultural, urban, or water change .

This approach was deterministic and threshold-based rather than probabilistic or machine learning-based.

---

### B. Reforestation Module

The restoration prioritization model followed a five-step SMCA workflow:

1. Criteria definition (expert consultation + literature review)
2. Data collection
3. Standardization
4. Weighting via AHP
5. Aggregation using weighted linear summation .

#### Criteria

Nine criteria were selected:

* Fire severity (dNBR)
* Fire frequency
* Tree density
* Land cover
* Slope
* Elevation
* Aspect
* Precipitation
* Mean temperature .

Criteria were standardized into ordinal classes (0,1,3,5) using literature-based thresholds .

#### Weighting

Pairwise comparisons using Saaty’s 1–9 scale were conducted. The largest eigenvalue λmax = 9.761, CI = 0.095, CR = 7%, below the 10% threshold, indicating acceptable consistency .

Weights showed strong dominance of fire severity (29.4%), followed by tree density (22.4%), land cover (16.9%), and fire history (10.1%) .

#### Aggregation

Weighted linear summation produced the Green-HIT Restoration Index (GRESTO):

GRESTO = ∑ (wi × Xi) .

The output was classified into Low, Medium, High priority.

---

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

Datasets included:

* Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery (10–20 m)
* Spectral indices (NDVI, NBR, dNBR, etc.)
* MODIS burned area
* CORINE land cover (100 m)
* SRTM (30 m)
* EFFIS fire history
* Copernicus tree density
* MODIS LST (1 km)
* CHIRPS precipitation (~5.5 km) .

The use of freely available datasets enhanced reproducibility. However, mixed spatial resolutions (10 m to 5.6 km) required reprojection and resampling, without quantitative analysis of scale-induced uncertainty.

---

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

The deforestation module produced a GeoTIFF raster highlighting detected change over one year, categorized by land-cover type .

The reforestation module produced priority maps (Low/Medium/High) and quantified area percentages within case studies. For Solea, 38% of burned area was classified as high priority; for Argaka, 52% .

Outputs were explicitly linked to management actions, distinguishing natural recovery from artificial restoration.

No quantification of carbon gains, biodiversity recovery, or hydrological benefits was provided.

---

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate was integrated indirectly through:

* Fire severity (dNBR)
* Fire frequency
* Temperature and precipitation suitability

However, no forward-looking climate change scenarios were incorporated. Risk was framed primarily as wildfire disturbance risk rather than climate vulnerability projection .

Thus, the model was reactive (post-fire) rather than anticipatory.

---

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic optimization (cost-effectiveness, NPV, ROI) was not addressed. The only economic argument concerned the cost-efficiency of GEE as a cloud platform .

Implementation considerations were partially embedded through expert consultation with DoF and comparison against actual restoration plans .

The document explicitly acknowledged that operational constraints (budget, accessibility) may explain divergence between model outputs and implemented actions .

---

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Deforestation module validation used 1000 random points against EFFIS and Hansen datasets, achieving 78.6% overall accuracy .

Reforestation validation used confusion matrices against DoF ground data:

## 10. Critical Assessment

The deliverable demonstrated methodological coherence and operational pragmatism. The deforestation module was transparent and computationally efficient, and the SMCA framework followed established AHP procedures with acceptable consistency metrics . Validation against independent datasets strengthened credibility.

However, robustness was limited by deterministic aggregation, OAT-only sensitivity testing, and absence of probabilistic uncertainty modeling. The reliance on expert-weighted criteria introduces structural subjectivity, even if internally consistent. Mixed spatial resolutions were harmonized but not critically evaluated for scale bias. Climate change was treated implicitly through disturbance metrics rather than future scenario modeling.

The tool is scalable within Cyprus due to standardized datasets and GEE deployment, but transferability depends on local expert input and institutional capacity. Overall, it constitutes a technically sound and practically implementable spatial decision-support system, with strong operational value but limited economic integration and forward-looking climate risk modeling.","spot sowing; broadhand seeding; planting; terraces; coppicing","Fire severity (Sentinel-2-derived dNBR); Fire frequency (EFFIS fire history); Tree density (Copernicus tree density); Land cover (CORINE land cover); Slope (SRTM); Elevation (SRTM); Aspect (SRTM); Precipitation (CHIRPS); Mean temperature (MODIS LST)","10-30 m (up to 1 km for temperature)","Spatial Multi-Criteria Analysis (SMCA) using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) weighting and Weighted Linear Sum aggregation to derive the Green-HIT Restoration Index (GRESTO) and classify areas as Low/Medium/High priority.","Deforestation validation with 1000 random points against EFFIS and Hansen datasets (78.6% overall accuracy); Reforestation validation using confusion matrices against DoF ground data (Solea 80.9% overall accuracy; Argaka 72.3% overall accuracy); Sensitivity analysis using One-At-A-Time (OAT) ±20% weight adjustments.","GRESTO (Green-HIT WP6 Deliverable D6.3)","GRESTO : A weighted-sum restoration index (Green-HIT Restoration Index) produced via a five-step SMCA workflow (criteria definition, data standardization, weighting with Saaty AHP, aggregation) using nine factors (fire severity, fire frequency, tree density, land cover, slope, elevation, aspect, precipitation, mean temperature) to generate Low/Medium/High priority maps and area percentages for post-fire reforestation decisions (natural regeneration vs artificial restoration) in Cyprus.","Deforestation change-detection map (forest loss, agricultural, urban, water change); Reforestation priority maps (Low/Medium/High) with area percentages (Solea high-priority 38%; Argaka high-priority 52%)","No","No","No","National: Cyprus; Local: Solea; Local: Argaka","The NbS addressed post-fire ecological restoration and a prioritization of reforestation/afforestation in Cyprus.

The report was produced to support Colombia’s accelerated national restoration agenda by translating broad international and national commitments into spatially explicit priorities. It framed ecosystem degradation, climate change, desertification, and land degradation as interlinked crises for which landscape restoration constituted a shared solution space, explicitly referencing alignment with the Rio Conventions, the Paris Agreement, and the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (Target 2).  The immediate policy driver was Colombia’s National Development Plan (2022–2026), which set a target to restore 750,000 additional hectares by 2026 in support of the National Plan for Ecological Restoration, Rehabilitation and Recovery of Degraded Areas (PNR) and the forthcoming 2026 National Restoration Strategy. 

The document’s rationale was methodological as well as political. It argued that achieving the restoration target required systematic, logic-driven prioritisation because restoration choices must contend with competing land uses, heterogeneous degradation states, and varying ecological benefits and climate risks. It therefore positioned geospatial analysis as “vital” for integrating multiple environmental and socio-ecological considerations into a national-scale prioritisation. 

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The report’s explicit objective was to provide Colombia with an “innovative geospatial analysis” that integrated biodiversity, climate change, and land degradation to identify priority areas for ecosystem restoration actions supporting the 2026 National Restoration Strategy.  The decision context was national strategic planning (rather than site-level project design): the outputs were intended to guide where restoration should be prioritised under a defined national target scenario (restoring 30% of degraded areas, linked to KM-GBF Target 2), and how priorities shift when incorporating opportunity cost proxies and climate risk proxies. 

The document also positioned the analysis as a platform for dialogue and co-creation: it sought to inform policy and project pipelines by providing maps and an interactive data workspace (UN Biodiversity Lab) that could be used by national actors for iterative refinement and application. 

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The intervention strategy was framed as ecosystem restoration at landscape scale, but the report operationalised “restoration” through a tripartite typology: ecological restoration, ecological rehabilitation, and ecological recovery.  This typology explicitly acknowledged feasibility constraints: in highly anthropised landscapes, full restoration to pre-disturbance composition/structure/function may be unrealistic, and alternative goals focused on productivity, ecosystem services, or “usefulness” may be more appropriate. 

Rather than prescribing specific NbS practices (e.g., assisted regeneration vs. planting), the report used spatial rules to classify priority areas into these three action categories based on human footprint intensity, land-use state (urban/agricultural vs. not), and whether the biome was projected to remain stable under climate change.  In effect, the NbS strategy was framed conceptually as a gradient of ecological ambition matched to constraints, with climate-driven biome change treated as a limiting factor for “true” restoration and a driver for rehabilitation or recovery framing. 

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

The analytical workflow was structured into six cartographic stages designed to move from ecological baselines to national priorities and action typologies. These stages included: mapping potential habitat distributions (baseline), mapping degradation and restoration opportunities, mapping potential benefits through multi-layer heat maps, generating a restoration priority map using spatial optimisation, assessing trade-offs/viability via opportunity-cost and climate-resilience proxies, and specifying action categories (restore–rehabilitate–recover). 

The unit of analysis was not described as a single fixed administrative unit; instead, the report referenced gridded habitat modelling at 250 m resolution for potential habitat classification and used national-scale raster layers for degradation, benefit, cost, and climate-risk surfaces.  The prioritisation stage explicitly used Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) methods and tools, applying a “maximum coverage algorithm” constrained by a budget defined as restoring 30% of the mapped degraded area, with the objective of maximising restoration benefits. 

Variable selection was deliberately multi-domain. The “potential benefits” component aggregated approximately 30 cartographic layers reflecting biodiversity, carbon, water security, desertification control, and socio-territorial attributes (including poverty rates in rural areas, Indigenous areas, Black Community Councils, family farming, and peasant reserve zones).  The aggregation logic was additive: each layer was converted into a relative value surface and summed to generate a heat map representing “agreement and synergies” among multiple benefits.  The report further introduced a weighting step to adjust layer influence, with weights elicited from experts and stakeholders (scored 1–5, then averaged to a composite weight per layer). 

Uncertainty treatment was primarily scenario-based rather than probabilistic. The prioritisation was repeated under different “cost layers” to test sensitivity to opportunity-cost and climate-risk constraints, but the report did not describe uncertainty propagation, error bounds, or sensitivity of priorities to alternative ecological model parameters. 

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The evidence base combined national datasets and global/ecoregional modelling products. Potential habitats were mapped using an IUCN habitat classification scheme built via a decision tree using vegetation cover potential, climate, elevation, and topography, based on a 1970–2015 reference climatology at 250 m resolution.  Potential ecosystems were also referenced from national ecosystem mapping work connected to the Red List of Ecosystems initiative, using a functional classification approach emphasising water balance gradients shaped by altitude/temperature and substrate constraints. 

Degraded areas were defined through a rule combining low/very low ecological integrity with medium/high human footprint (and related footprint-derived layers), drawing on Humboldt Institute products and national integrity analyses integrating ecosystem diversity, connectivity, and ecosystem services.  The report stated that ~50.75% of Colombia’s land area was mapped as degraded, with particularly high degradation shares in Andean forest and tropical dry forests. 

Cost evidence relied on proxies. Opportunity cost was represented via agricultural suitability (maximum suitability across 16 basic crops) using suitability data for 2011–2040, and in the prioritisation stage this suitability surface was combined with a standardised national human footprint layer.  Climate risk used Velocity of Climate Change (VoCC) developed with projections to 2030 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 with four circulation models, alongside biome transition mapping for future epochs. 

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

The core outputs were national-scale maps corresponding to each workflow stage: (i) historical ecosystems and potential habitat distributions; (ii) degraded area/opportunity maps; (iii) a multi-layer restoration benefits heat map; (iv) a restoration priority map for restoring 30% of degraded areas; (v) alternative priority maps incorporating opportunity cost and climate-speed constraints; and (vi) maps disaggregating priority areas into restoration/rehabilitation/recovery action categories. 

The report quantified the prioritisation magnitude by linking the 30% degraded-area target to 15.2% of Colombia’s total surface as “priority restoration” under the optimisation constraint.  It also quantified the distribution of action categories within the prioritised area, stating that recovery dominated (86%), followed by restoration (11%) and rehabilitation (3%), which is decision-relevant for implementation framing and expectations about achievable ecological outcomes. 

Quantified impacts (e.g., carbon tonnes sequestered, biodiversity outcomes) were not reported in the document’s technical narrative; benefits were represented through the aggregated heat map approach rather than explicit biophysical outcome modelling. 

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was integrated as an explicit constraint on restoration success through the VoCC proxy, which operationalised climate risk as the speed and direction species would need to move to track current climates, with high velocity interpreted as higher climate change impact.  The prioritisation was re-run to “minimise high climate speed” using a standardised VoCC 8.5 layer as a cost-like penalty surface, thereby embedding climate risk directly in spatial allocation logic. 

The report also included biome transition maps under climate change scenarios, comparing epochs through 2080, which were then used in the action-typing rules that distinguished restoration from rehabilitation (biome stable vs. biome change expected).  However, climate was not integrated as a dynamic ecological response model for restoration outcomes; rather, it was treated as a spatial risk filter and as a categorical determinant of feasible restoration ambition. 

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic analysis was limited to opportunity-cost proxying and did not include direct implementation costs, financing strategies, or cost-effectiveness metrics such as ROI or NPV. The report acknowledged that implementation costs are conceptually distinct from opportunity costs, but it explicitly relied on agricultural suitability as an indirect surrogate because direct costs may not be readily available. 

Implementation logic was addressed mainly through governance process design rather than operational delivery planning. The report emphasised stakeholder involvement throughout, and it described how results would be delivered through a national workspace in the UN Biodiversity Lab to enable access, download, and iterative use by national administrators and public users.  Financing mechanisms, institutional feasibility filters (tenure, security, legality), and implementation sequencing were not addressed in the document.

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Robustness was pursued through co-creation, expert review, and scenario comparison rather than formal validation against observed restoration outcomes. The process included an initial national consultation (with participation reported as more than 140 experts) to identify data gaps and update layers, a subsequent expert weighting session to assign relative influence to layers, and a second consultation to present results and gather concerns and intended uses. 

The report did not describe empirical validation of priority maps (e.g., comparing prioritised areas to independent measures of restoration success or biodiversity recovery), nor did it report sensitivity analysis on the optimisation outputs beyond the alternative cost/climate scenarios. Limitations related to proxy choices (agricultural suitability for opportunity cost; VoCC for climate risk) were implied by the methodology but not critically quantified in the text. 

## 10. Critical Assessment

The report’s principal methodological strength was its explicit attempt to integrate biodiversity, land degradation, and climate risk within a systematic conservation planning optimisation framework that remained aligned with Colombia’s near-term national targets.  Analytical transparency was moderate: the six-stage workflow and the conceptual roles of benefit layers, opportunity-cost proxies, and climate-risk proxies were clearly stated, yet the report provided limited detail on the optimisation implementation (e.g., objective function specification, representation targets, constraints beyond area budget, and algorithm settings).  The additive heat-map approach and stakeholder-derived weighting improved policy relevance but introduced subjectivity; without reporting how sensitive spatial priorities were to alternative weights or layer inclusion, the robustness of conclusions about “priority” remains partially untested.  The action-typing logic (restore/rehabilitate/recover) was conceptually appropriate for feasibility-aware planning, but it risked embedding strong assumptions—particularly the binary treatment of biome stability and the use of a human-footprint percentile threshold to determine what is “possible”—without empirical justification in the document.  Transferability to other countries is plausible at the workflow level, but practical scalability within Colombia will depend on whether the proxy layers (agricultural suitability; VoCC) adequately represent real constraints and whether implementation institutions can reconcile priority maps with tenure, conflict, and financing realities not modelled here.","assisted regeneration","Potential habitat distributions (IUCN habitat classification scheme); Vegetation cover potential (IUCN habitat classification scheme); Climate (IUCN habitat classification scheme); Elevation (IUCN habitat classification scheme); Topography (IUCN habitat classification scheme); Water balance gradients (National ecosystem mapping work connected to Red List of Ecosystems initiative); Altitude/temperature (National ecosystem mapping work connected to Red List of Ecosystems initiative); Substrate constraints (National ecosystem mapping work connected to Red List of Ecosystems initiative); Ecological integrity (Humboldt Institute products and national integrity analyses); Human footprint (Humboldt Institute products and national integrity analyses); Degraded areas (Humboldt Institute products and national integrity analyses); Agricultural suitability (suitability data for 2011–2040); National human footprint (standardised national human footprint layer); Velocity of Climate Change (VoCC) (Projections to 2030 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 with four circulation models); Biome transition mapping (Biome transition maps under climate change scenarios)","250 m resolution","Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP) with a maximum-coverage, budget-constrained spatial-optimisation on 250 m gridded habitat data and national raster layers; additive, weighted aggregation of ~30 benefit layers into a multi-layer heat map; scenario-based assessment using alternative cost surfaces for opportunity cost and climate risk.","Expert review and stakeholder validation through national consultations and an expert-weighting session (co-creation); scenario comparison using alternative cost layers for opportunity cost and climate risk.","NA","NA","Restoration priority map [priority restoration; 30% degraded-area target]; Alternative priority maps [opportunity-cost-aware; climate-risk-aware]; Priority-area action-category maps [restore; rehabilitation; recover]; Degraded area/opportunity maps [degraded areas; opportunity areas]; Multi-layer restoration benefits heat map [biodiversity; carbon; water security; desertification control; socio-territorial attributes]","Yes: They explicitly treat climate hazards as a barrier to NbS effectiveness by framing climate risk as a constraint on restoration success and a determinant of feasible ambition, demonstrated by re-running the spatial prioritisation with climate-risk constraints (minimizing high climate speed) and by using biome-transition maps to classify priority areas into restoration, rehabilitation, or recovery based on expected biome stability under climate change.","Yes: Climate change is used as a driver/constraint in the NbS prioritisation by minimising high climate-velocity areas and using biome-transition maps to gate feasible restoration, with outputs producing priority maps and action categories that reflect reduced climate risk and co-benefits such as carbon and water security.","Yes: It includes economic aspects only as opportunity-cost proxies (agricultural suitability paired with a human-footprint cost-like surface used to test cost constraints) in the spatial prioritisation; there are no economic outputs such as ROI, NPV, cost-benefit, or cost-effectiveness metrics reported; livelihoods are represented indirectly via poverty-related socio-territorial layers in the benefit aggregation, but there is no explicit economic framing as a selection criterion or payments for ecosystem services.","National: Colombia","The NbS addressed was landscape-scale ecosystem restoration, implemented as ecological restoration, rehabilitation, and recovery.

**Mapping Potential for Cocoa Agroforestry in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire (2021)** 

---

## 1. Context and Rationale

The report was developed in response to persistent deforestation and forest degradation linked to cocoa expansion in West Africa, particularly in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. These two countries account for a dominant share of global cocoa production and have experienced significant forest loss associated with agricultural encroachment, low-yield cocoa systems, and expansion into protected areas. The document framed cocoa agroforestry as a Nature-based Solution capable of reconciling production, biodiversity conservation, and climate mitigation.

The central problem addressed was the absence of spatially explicit evidence to guide where cocoa agroforestry could be promoted most effectively and sustainably. While agroforestry has been widely endorsed as a sustainable cocoa production model, the report argued that adoption potential varies significantly due to biophysical constraints, climatic suitability, socio-economic conditions, and existing land use patterns. A geospatial prioritisation was therefore required to identify areas with high suitability and high environmental benefit potential, while avoiding areas unsuitable for cocoa or critical for strict conservation.

The rationale combined ecological restoration objectives with supply-chain sustainability commitments, including zero-deforestation pledges and landscape-level restoration targets. The study sought to provide a planning tool that could guide investment and policy support for agroforestry expansion without exacerbating forest conversion.

---

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The primary objective was to map and quantify the potential for cocoa agroforestry expansion across Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire using a spatial suitability and prioritisation framework. The decision context was multi-level: national agricultural and restoration planning, donor and private-sector investment targeting, and sustainability strategy design within cocoa supply chains.

Specifically, the study aimed to identify (i) areas biophysically suitable for cocoa agroforestry, (ii) degraded or low-tree-cover cocoa areas where agroforestry intensification could increase tree cover and carbon storage, and (iii) landscapes where agroforestry could contribute to climate mitigation and biodiversity benefits.

The outputs were intended to inform strategic investment planning and restoration programming rather than site-specific farm design. The emphasis was on identifying scalable intervention zones aligned with both production goals and environmental safeguards.

---

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The intervention strategy centered on cocoa agroforestry systems integrating shade trees within cocoa production landscapes. Agroforestry was framed as a multifunctional NbS delivering climate mitigation (through carbon sequestration in shade trees), biodiversity habitat enhancement, soil conservation, and microclimate regulation.

The report conceptualised agroforestry as an intensification and diversification pathway rather than as pure ecological restoration. It aimed to enhance tree cover within existing cocoa landscapes and potentially expand cocoa production in climatically suitable but degraded areas under agroforestry configurations.

Importantly, agroforestry was differentiated from cocoa expansion into natural forests. The framework incorporated safeguards to avoid identifying intact forests or high conservation value areas as priority zones for agroforestry development. Thus, the intervention strategy was embedded within a “no-deforestation” constraint.

The study did not compare alternative agroforestry typologies (e.g., shade density gradients or species mixes) quantitatively. Instead, it treated agroforestry generically as a tree-integrated cocoa production system.

---

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

### Geographic Scope and Unit of Analysis

The spatial scope covered national territories of Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. The unit of analysis was raster-based, integrating multiple geospatial layers at moderate spatial resolution (generally between 30 m and 1 km depending on dataset). The analysis was conducted at national scale, enabling consistent cross-border comparison.

### Modelling Logic

The analytical approach followed a multi-step spatial filtering and suitability scoring process:

1. Identification of cocoa-growing areas and potential expansion zones.
2. Application of climatic suitability modelling for cocoa production.
3. Exclusion of protected areas and high forest integrity zones.
4. Assessment of environmental co-benefit potential (e.g., carbon storage and tree cover restoration opportunity).
5. Overlay and aggregation into suitability classes.

Climatic suitability was assessed using temperature and precipitation thresholds aligned with cocoa agronomy literature. Areas outside optimal ranges were excluded or down-weighted. This step operationalised climate as a biophysical constraint.

Forest and conservation layers were applied as exclusion masks to ensure agroforestry prioritisation did not promote forest conversion. This represented a rule-based filtering rather than optimisation-based trade-off resolution.

Environmental co-benefits were incorporated through layers representing degraded lands, existing tree cover, and restoration opportunity potential. The final suitability map was categorised into discrete classes (e.g., high, medium, low potential).

### Weighting and Scoring

The report used additive overlay methods rather than formal optimisation (e.g., linear programming). Criteria were standardised and combined through a weighted or rule-based aggregation approach. No explicit mathematical optimisation objective function was described.

### Uncertainty Treatment

Uncertainty treatment was limited. The study acknowledged uncertainties in climate projections and land cover classification but did not propagate these uncertainties quantitatively. No probabilistic modelling or Monte Carlo simulation was reported.

---

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The modelling framework relied on diverse spatial datasets:

* Climate data (temperature, precipitation)
* Cocoa distribution and production maps
* Land cover and forest integrity maps
* Protected area boundaries
* Tree cover and biomass layers
* Degradation and restoration opportunity datasets

These datasets were derived from global and national sources, including remote sensing products. Climate suitability thresholds were grounded in agronomic literature.

A limitation was the heterogeneity in spatial resolution across layers. The report harmonised datasets via resampling but did not systematically evaluate the implications of scale mismatch. Socioeconomic variables such as land tenure, farmer capacity, or market access were not deeply integrated, representing a gap in feasibility assessment.

---

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

The primary outputs included:

* National maps of cocoa agroforestry suitability.
* Classification of land into high, medium, and low potential zones.
* Quantification of area (hectares) within each suitability class.
* Maps illustrating potential carbon sequestration benefits through increased tree cover.
* Overlays identifying alignment with restoration opportunity zones.

These products enabled estimation of the total area where agroforestry expansion or intensification could occur without encroaching on intact forests. They provided a spatial basis for targeting investment and policy support.

However, the report did not present quantified carbon sequestration projections (e.g., tonnes CO₂ per hectare) or biodiversity metrics in numeric form. Benefits were inferred spatially rather than modelled dynamically.

---

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate was integrated primarily as a suitability constraint. Temperature and precipitation thresholds determined whether cocoa agroforestry could be agronomically viable. The analysis considered current climate conditions rather than dynamic future climate scenarios.

Climate change risk was not modelled explicitly in terms of future suitability shifts, drought risk, or adaptation capacity. Agroforestry was implicitly framed as climate adaptation (e.g., shade moderating heat stress), but this was not analytically modelled.

Thus, climate was treated as a static biophysical filter rather than as a dynamic driver.

---

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

The report did not include cost-effectiveness, ROI, or NPV calculations. Economic feasibility was addressed only indirectly, through suitability and avoidance of high conservation areas.

No detailed assessment of farmer adoption costs, incentive mechanisms, or financing strategies was included. Implementation considerations such as land tenure security, extension services, or institutional capacity were acknowledged qualitatively but not spatially modelled.

Thus, economic integration remained limited relative to ecological modelling.

---

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

The study did not report empirical validation against observed agroforestry adoption patterns. Sensitivity analysis of weighting parameters was not described.

Limitations acknowledged included data quality constraints, uncertainties in land cover classification, and potential mismatch between climatic suitability and socio-economic feasibility.

Because the model relied heavily on rule-based exclusions and additive scoring, robustness to alternative weighting schemes was not systematically evaluated.

---

## 10. Critical Assessment

The report demonstrated methodological clarity in combining climate suitability, land-use filters, and environmental benefit overlays into a coherent prioritisation framework. Its principal strength lay in integrating zero-deforestation safeguards with agroforestry expansion mapping at national scale.

However, analytical robustness was constrained by the absence of formal optimisation or trade-off modelling. Additive scoring may oversimplify complex interactions among climate, land use, and socio-economic constraints. Climate change was treated statically, limiting forward-looking adaptation planning.

Economic feasibility and farmer-level constraints were insufficiently integrated, which may reduce real-world implementability of priority maps. While scalable and transparent, the framework would benefit from explicit uncertainty propagation, dynamic climate projections, and integration of socio-economic data layers.

Overall, the document provided a valuable strategic screening tool for cocoa agroforestry expansion, but it remained stronger in environmental suitability assessment than in comprehensive, investment-grade landscape planning.","NA","Temperature (global and national sources, remote sensing products); Precipitation (global and national sources, remote sensing products); Cocoa distribution and production maps (global and national sources); Land cover (global and national sources); Forest integrity (global and national sources); Protected areas (global and national sources); Tree cover (global and national sources); Biomass (global and national sources); Degraded lands (global and national sources); Restoration opportunity potential (global and national sources)","30 m to 1 km (depending on dataset)","A multi-step spatial filtering and additive overlay scoring workflow: climate suitability modelling with temperature/precipitation thresholds; exclusion of protected/high-forest areas; overlay of environmental co-benefits (degraded lands, existing tree cover, restoration potential); and aggregation into discrete suitability classes under a rule-based, non-optimisation framework.","Not adressed in paper","NA","NA","Cocoa agroforestry suitability map (high, medium, low); Suitability-class area (ha) by class (high, medium, low); Carbon sequestration potential map through increased tree cover; Restoration opportunity alignment overlay map; Expansion-area map under no-deforestation constraint (ha)","No","Yes: The authors target areas where cocoa agroforestry could deliver climate mitigation (carbon sequestration) and adaptation co-benefits, demonstrated by outputs mapping potential carbon sequestration from increased tree cover and overlays with restoration opportunity zones to identify priority areas.","No","Multi-country: Ghana; Côte d’Ivoire","The NbS addressed cocoa agroforestry systems with shade trees in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, framed as a Nature-based Solution delivering climate mitigation, biodiversity, soil conservation, and microclimate, with a no-deforestation constraint.

Context and Rationale

The document addressed the strategic problem of aligning cocoa-sector production goals with forest and biodiversity policy objectives in Ghana, where cocoa landscapes overlap with remaining high-value forests and associated ecosystem services. It framed the central tension as a coupled land-use and livelihoods challenge: low-shade cocoa expansion and intensification can increase pressure on intact forests and degrade ecosystem service provision, while poorly designed interventions risk maladaptation under climate change. The rationale for spatial analysis was therefore to identify where agroforestry-oriented management changes could plausibly deliver “co-benefits” (biodiversity intactness, carbon storage, sediment regulation) while acknowledging that climate change could shift cocoa suitability and alter risk profiles of interventions. The argument that agroforestry design must explicitly consider future climate conditions and hazard profiles was linked to projected rainfall variability, pest/disease dynamics, and the need to avoid inefficient resource allocation. 

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The study’s decision context was investment and programme targeting: it aimed to map “opportunity areas” for agroforestry and climate-smart cocoa practices that would advance both cocoa and forest policy objectives, especially in and around forest reserves and across climate-impact “zones.” It operationalised this as scenario-based spatial comparison of land-use management pathways (including “avoided losses”) and subsequent prioritisation of locations where expected co-benefits were greatest. It was positioned as a decision-support product for directing restoration/enhancement efforts (shade increases, land-use transitions) rather than forecasting farmer behaviour or modelling cocoa expansion. 

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The intervention logic was framed as tree-cover enhancement within cocoa systems (agroforestry) and targeted transitions to alternative tree crops where cocoa becomes climatically unsuitable. The scenarios defined a gradient of shade-based agroforestry intensities and spatial targeting rules. “Transition to shaded cocoa” converted monoculture cocoa to 30–40% shade (with higher shade in forest reserves), while “transition to shaded cocoa+” extended the higher-shade prescription into a 1 km buffer around forest reserves.  The “climate-smart cocoa” scenario applied spatially explicit recommendations based on climate-smart cocoa “recommendation domains,” translated into adaptation zones (coping/opportunity, adjustment, transformation) with different minimum shade and land-use recommendations; within forest reserves, cocoa was assigned to very high shade (50–70%) as a restoration-supporting measure.  The “transformation zone” explicitly shifted cocoa to “other tree crops,” indicating that the NbS framing included both adaptation (maintaining resilient cocoa through shade and best practices) and planned transition (livelihood-compatible tree crops) under climate unsuitability. 

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

The geographic scope was national (Ghana), with analyses conducted on gridded land-cover surfaces (cell-based outputs mapped nationwide), including explicit treatment of forest reserves and a 1 km buffer rule in one scenario.  The analytical structure followed a scenario-to-impact pipeline: (i) generate land-cover maps for current (2019) and counterfactual/intervention scenarios, (ii) compute indicator changes (biodiversity intactness, carbon, sediment export), and (iii) combine selected indicators into a prioritisation surface. Land-cover change rules were deterministic and scenario-specific (e.g., all monoculture cocoa transitioned to shaded classes; reserves received prescribed higher shade; transformation zones reassigned to other tree crops), enabling attribution of mapped benefits to explicit policy levers rather than to an optimisation routine. 

For carbon, the study used a per-class stock-density accounting approach: it derived aboveground carbon stocks for cocoa shade-tree components using a linear relationship with crown cover from Acheampong et al. (2014), then combined this with a fixed cocoa-tree carbon stock to generate total aboveground tree biomass carbon by cocoa management class.   Carbon densities for other land-cover classes were sourced from literature (including default IPCC values where appropriate), assigned to scenario land-cover rasters, and multiplied by cell area to compute national totals.   Critically, the method excluded soil organic carbon, belowground biomass, deadwood, and litter pools, which the document acknowledged would likely underestimate differences between low-shade and shaded systems. 

For biodiversity, it applied a Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) coefficient approach by matching land-cover classes to PREDICTS land-use categories and intensity levels, then assigning BII coefficients per class. 

The prioritisation combined biophysical benefit layers with accessibility/pressure proxies: it highlighted proximity to forests (connectivity and habitat value) and to roads/settlements (market access but also increased pressure and tree removal risk), implying a multi-criteria overlay rather than an optimisation.  Treatment of uncertainty was largely qualitative, discussed through parameter uncertainty and definitional ambiguity rather than via probabilistic propagation or sensitivity testing. 

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The evidence base integrated (i) a national land-cover map for 2019 used as the baseline,  (ii) climate-smart cocoa recommendation domains and associated adaptation-zone logic (Bunn et al. 2019) plus practice descriptions from a climate-smart cocoa training manual,  (iii) carbon stock-density parameters from literature and IPCC defaults,  and (iv) BII coefficients derived from PREDICTS-based land-use/intensity categories.  The document explicitly flagged limitations in management-class definitions (e.g., “monoculture” representing both zero-shade and low/mild shade systems) and noted that inconsistent shade definitions across studies constrained parameter selection and comparability.  

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

Outputs included national maps of scenario land cover, BII under current conditions and change surfaces per scenario, and aboveground carbon stock maps under current land use with scenario-driven change maps.   The results were also summarised as national totals of aboveground biomass carbon per scenario (e.g., current and scenario totals and differences), enabling policy actors to compare aggregate mitigation potential.  Scenario area accounting quantified the magnitude of land-cover transitions, including the expansion of high-shade cocoa under buffer targeting and the introduction of very high shade under climate-smart cocoa.  The decision relevance lay in comparing where interventions delivered (a) avoided biodiversity loss relative to a low-shade trajectory and (b) carbon gains relative to current management, which could inform prioritised implementation geographies rather than prescribing farm-level packages. 

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was integrated as a driver for targeting and as a determinant of feasible interventions through the climate-smart cocoa recommendation domains, translated into three adaptation zones with different management prescriptions (minimum shade thresholds and, in the transformation zone, crop substitution).  The analysis treated climate primarily as a spatial classification layer guiding scenario rules, rather than modelling climate impacts on yields, pests, or ecosystem services directly. It also explicitly stated that while some areas may become suitable under future climates, cocoa expansion into those areas was not modelled. 

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic valuation, cost-effectiveness, ROI/NPV, or financing mechanisms were not quantified in the modelling outputs. The document instead discussed implementation feasibility through qualitative risk and trade-off considerations: it noted that proximity to roads and settlements could improve market access for secondary crops but might also increase pressure leading to tree removal and reversion to less shaded systems, implying a need for incentives and mitigation measures.  It further acknowledged likely short-term trade-offs (upfront costs, reduced cocoa production during transition, pests/disease risks from incorrect shade design) and institutional/socio-economic barriers to scaling, emphasising the need for ongoing support.   Gender considerations were raised as an implementation-design issue (differences in household roles affecting preferred tree species and system design), but without integration into spatial prioritisation metrics. 

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Formal validation and sensitivity analysis were not described in the retrieved sections. The document did, however, articulate several robustness limitations: exclusion of major carbon pools (SOC, belowground, deadwood, litter) likely biased estimates downward for benefits of higher shade.  It also noted high uncertainty in carbon values due to dependence on shade-tree density, age, species, and ecological zone.  A major structural limitation was definitional: baseline land cover did not distinguish high/very high shade cocoa, leading to assumptions about rarity and potential misclassification, and “monoculture” likely aggregated multiple shade regimes.  Literature comparability constraints (inconsistent shade metrics across studies) further limited parameter confidence. 

## 10. Critical Assessment

Methodologically, the study’s strongest feature was its transparent scenario logic, which linked policy-relevant rules (forest reserve targeting, buffer prescriptions, climate-adaptation zones) to mapped ecosystem-service outcomes in a way that supports comparative planning.  However, the analytical robustness was constrained by heavy reliance on static per-class coefficients for both biodiversity and carbon, with limited exploration of parameter sensitivity or uncertainty propagation despite acknowledged uncertainty and definitional ambiguity.  The exclusion of major carbon pools and the acknowledged difficulty of mapping shade classes from baseline land cover likely introduced systematic bias, particularly underestimating gains from shade intensification and potentially misallocating priority areas.   Climate integration was conceptually strong (adaptation zoning), but analytically limited because it did not simulate yield or pest/disease dynamics, meaning “climate-smart” recommendations were applied as rules rather than tested as performance under scenarios.  Finally, the absence of quantified costs and adoption constraints in the prioritisation limits operational transferability; the document itself implied that proximity-based feasibility can cut both ways and requires local safeguards, suggesting that the mapped priorities should be treated as a screening layer rather than an investment plan.","transition to shaded cocoa; transition to shaded cocoa+","Land-cover map (2019 baseline) (National land-cover map for 2019); Climate-smart cocoa recommendation domains (Bunn et al. 2019); Adaptation zones (coping/opportunity, adjustment, transformation) (Bunn et al. 2019); Biodiversity Intactness Index coefficients (PREDICTS-based land-use categories and intensity levels); Aboveground carbon stocks (cocoa shade-tree components) (Acheampong et al. 2014); Carbon densities for other land-cover classes (IPCC defaults)","NA","Nationwide gridded land-cover maps for baseline and intervention scenarios were generated and altered using deterministic, scenario-specific land-cover change rules; biodiversity was estimated with a BII coefficient approach matched to land-cover classes, carbon was derived with a per-class stock-density method, and these indicators were overlaid in a multi-criteria prioritisation surface incorporating proximity to forests and to roads/settlements.","Not adressed in paper","NA","NA","Scenario land-cover maps [monoculture cocoa; shaded cocoa; very high shade 50–70% near forest reserves; other tree crops]; Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) maps and change surfaces [current-condition BII; per-scenario BII change surfaces]; Aboveground carbon stock maps and change maps [current land-use carbon stocks; scenario-driven changes; national totals and differences]; Land-cover change/transition area maps [magnitude of transitions, e.g., area shifted to high-shade cocoa and to other tree crops]","Yes: Climate hazards are treated as a risk that could constrain where agroforestry-based NbS are feasible and effective, through climate-smart cocoa adaptation zones that prescribe different shading and crop substitutions depending on future conditions; the authors demonstrate this with scenario-based spatial outputs that classify future suitability and screen priority areas, though yields and pest dynamics are not directly modelled.","Yes: climate change is explicitly used as a driver to target NbS—through climate-smart cocoa adaptation zones and higher-shade agroforestry in forest buffers—so that NbS delivers adaptation and mitigation benefits, demonstrated via scenario-based prioritisation maps showing avoided biodiversity losses and carbon gains across climate-adaptation zones.","No","National: Ghana","NbS addressed: agroforestry/tree-cover enhancement within Ghana cocoa landscapes, with transitions to shaded cocoa and to other tree crops where cocoa becomes unsuitable, including climate-smart cocoa across adaptation zones.

**National Land Commission (2019). County Spatial Planning in Pastoral Areas – Toolkit III: Developing Scenarios and Formulating Plan Proposals** 

---

## 1. Context and Rationale

The Toolkit was developed to address the unique planning challenges of pastoral counties in Kenya within the County Spatial Planning (CSP) framework. It focused specifically on Steps 5 and 6 of the CSP process—developing scenarios and formulating plan proposals—recognizing that pastoral areas are characterized by mobile livelihoods, shared and seasonal resource use, fragile rangeland ecosystems, and climate variability. 

The underlying problem was that conventional spatial planning approaches often inadequately capture the mobility, seasonality, and common-property dynamics of rangeland systems. In pastoral contexts, poorly designed infrastructure (e.g., water points, irrigation schemes, settlements) can fragment stock routes, degrade drought reserves, and undermine resilience. Therefore, the intervention was needed to adapt statutory county planning processes to the socio-ecological logic of pastoral systems, ensuring that land-use zoning, capital investment, and infrastructure decisions do not inadvertently erode pastoral production systems.

The Toolkit positioned scenario development as a critical bridge between diagnostic analysis (Steps 1–4) and statutory plan adoption (Step 6), embedding participatory negotiation and rangeland-sensitive evaluation mechanisms within the CSP.

---

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The primary objective was to guide county governments in developing and evaluating alternative development scenarios for pastoral areas and translating them into an implementable County Spatial Plan. 

The decision context was regulatory and strategic. Counties must legally produce spatial plans that define land-use zoning, development controls, capital investment priorities, and implementation frameworks. The Toolkit aimed to ensure that scenario selection and zoning decisions explicitly consider rangeland productivity, livestock mobility, climate risk, and inter-community resource sharing.

The outputs were intended to inform statutory land-use zoning, infrastructure siting, investment sequencing, and Capital Investment Plans (CIPs), thereby shaping long-term territorial development trajectories.

---

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The intervention strategy was not framed explicitly as “Nature-based Solutions,” but its core logic aligned strongly with NbS principles. It emphasized protection and sustainable management of rangelands, drought reserves, stock routes, and shared grazing areas. 

The proposed strategies included:

* Zoning of drought reserves and stock routes to protect livestock mobility. 
* Integration of wildlife–livestock multiple-use zones. 
* Strategic location of water points to avoid overgrazing and disruption of seasonal pasture systems. 

The Toolkit framed pastoral systems as productive landscapes requiring coordinated governance rather than conversion to sedentary land uses. Agro-pastoral and livestock growth zones were proposed as formal zoning categories to support the livestock economy. 

Conceptually, the intervention combined ecological restoration (e.g., land rehabilitation works in CIPs), climate adaptation (drought reserve protection), and livelihood support (livestock market infrastructure, fodder zones).

---

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

### Geographic Scope and Unit of Analysis

The framework operated at county scale, consistent with Kenya’s devolved governance structure. Spatial representation was GIS-based, requiring thematic maps and overlay analyses to evaluate land-use alternatives. 

### Modelling and Scenario Logic

The analytical process followed a structured sequence:

1. Development of a “nil intervention” (business-as-usual) scenario projecting trends over 10–30 years. 
2. Brainstorming alternative scenarios with stakeholders. 
3. Spatial overlay analysis to compare implications for resources and livelihoods. 
4. Multi-method evaluation (cost-benefit analysis, environmental appraisal, socio-cultural appraisal). 
5. Stakeholder ranking and negotiation of land-use alternatives. 

The nil-intervention scenario incorporated trend interaction analysis and recognition of tipping points and non-linear dynamics.  However, quantitative modelling was optional rather than mandatory.

### Overlay and Scoring

Overlay analysis was used to identify spatial conflicts between proposed developments and key rangeland resources. 

For water point planning, a semi-quantitative GIS scoring system was proposed, assigning positive and negative scores to spatial pixels based on ecological and socio-political criteria.  This represented one of the few explicit algorithmic prioritization components.

### Treatment of Uncertainty

Uncertainty was acknowledged in scenario projection, particularly regarding non-linear dynamics and feedback effects.  However, no formal sensitivity analysis or probabilistic modelling was prescribed.

---

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The Toolkit assumed prior data assembly during earlier CSP stages. Required data layers included:

* Land use and land tenure maps
* Protected areas and sensitive ecosystems
* Stock routes and water points
* Conflict hotspots
* Community grazing plans 

It emphasized participatory mapping and stakeholder consultation to supplement GIS data. 

Data integration was primarily qualitative or semi-quantitative. The Toolkit did not specify standardized ecological indicators (e.g., vegetation indices) or hydrological models.

---

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

The final outputs included:

* Evaluated plan scenarios
* Zoning maps
* Implementation matrices
* Capital Investment Plans (CIPs) 

Land-use zones were explicitly defined (e.g., community grazing areas, drought reserves, stock routes, wildlife–livestock zones). 

The CIP required costing and sequencing of major investments such as dams, boreholes, abattoirs, and livestock markets. 

Decision support was provided through scenario comparison, ranking exercises, and negotiated agreements rather than through optimization modelling.

---

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was treated as a central risk driver affecting pastoral systems, with emphasis on droughts, floods, and erratic rainfall. 

The Toolkit recommended integrating disaster management guidelines and zoning drought reserves to enhance resilience. However, climate change was framed narratively rather than through quantitative hazard modelling or climate projections.

Climate risk influenced planning through precautionary zoning (e.g., restrictions in drought reserves) and water infrastructure prioritization, rather than through dynamic climate scenario modelling.

---

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic analysis was incorporated via cost-benefit analysis and payback-period calculations. 

The CIP required financial capacity assessment, funding strategy development, and prioritization of quick wins versus long-term projects. 

Implementation logic included sequencing, catalyst projects, and public-private partnerships. However, no macroeconomic modelling or fiscal risk analysis was included.

---

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Validation relied heavily on stakeholder engagement and negotiation. 

Technical robustness depended on data quality and participatory accuracy. The Toolkit acknowledged power asymmetries and negotiation dynamics, suggesting awareness of socio-political biases. 

However, no formal validation metrics, scenario stress-testing, or monitoring indicators were detailed.

---

## 10. Critical Assessment

The Toolkit’s principal strength lay in its explicit recognition of pastoral socio-ecological dynamics and the institutionalization of participatory negotiation within spatial planning. Its structured scenario process and integration of overlay analysis provided a clear procedural logic.

However, analytically it remained largely qualitative, with limited quantitative modelling or uncertainty propagation. The absence of standardized ecological indicators and climate projections constrains technical robustness. The GIS scoring approach for water points demonstrated potential but was not extended systematically to other planning elements.

The reliance on stakeholder negotiation, while socially appropriate, may introduce biases where power asymmetries are pronounced. Transferability is high within pastoral governance contexts but depends heavily on institutional capacity and data availability.

Overall, the Toolkit functioned as a governance-oriented decision-support manual rather than a technically rigorous environmental modelling framework.","NA","Land use and land tenure maps (Toolkit III); Protected areas and sensitive ecosystems (Toolkit III); Stock routes and water points (Toolkit III); Conflict hotspots (Toolkit III); Community grazing plans (Toolkit III)","NA","GIS-based overlay analysis to identify spatial conflicts between proposed developments and key rangeland resources; a semi-quantitative GIS scoring system assigning positive/negative scores to spatial pixels for water-point planning.","Stakeholder engagement and negotiation","NA","NA","Zoning maps (community grazing areas, drought reserves, stock routes, wildlife–livestock zones)","Yes: They treat climate hazards as a central risk driver that could undermine the NbS’s suitability and resilience, and demonstrate this in outputs by using precautionary zoning (drought reserves) and prioritizing water infrastructure to reflect climate risk, though the framing relies on narrative risk rather than quantitative hazard modelling.","Yes: climate hazards such as droughts and erratic rainfall are used as the reason to target NbS-like actions (zoning drought reserves, protecting stock routes, coordinating water points) to bolster pastoral resilience, and the authors demonstrate this through scenario-based prioritisation and outputs that explicitly designate drought-reserve zones and mobility-supporting infrastructure as priority land-use outcomes.","Yes: Economic aspects are integrated in the OUTPUT analysis through explicit cost-benefit analysis and payback-period calculations; the CIP includes costing, sequencing of major investments, and a financial capacity assessment, with prioritization of quick wins versus long-term projects; however, the approach does not include macroeconomic modelling or fiscal risk analysis.","Sub-national: Kenya","The NbS practice addressed—though not framed as NbS—focused on protecting and sustainably managing rangelands, drought reserves, stock routes, and shared grazing areas in Kenyan pastoral counties.

Context and Rationale

The document framed improved forages and feeding strategies as a strategic lever for “sustainable intensification” of livestock systems under rising demand for livestock products and escalating pressure on land and other resources.  It positioned the livestock sector as simultaneously central to rural livelihoods and a contributor to environmental pressures, explicitly citing concerns such as nutrient loads, food–feed competition, greenhouse gas emissions, water use, and land-use conversion.  The rationale for a spatial planning intervention followed from a specific causal claim: some of the most important climate change impacts on livestock systems were mediated through climate impacts on feed availability and suitability, implying that adaptation in livestock systems required anticipatory management of forage options, not only animal-side interventions. 

The document’s logic further emphasised distributive vulnerability: it highlighted Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia as both highly climate-vulnerable and highly livestock-dependent regions, thereby justifying decision support tailored to smallholders and development practitioners rather than to purely commercial systems.  In this framing, suitability mapping was needed to reduce maladaptive or inefficient forage promotion by aligning species/varieties with local conditions now and under plausible future climates, thereby improving eco-efficiency while protecting livelihoods.

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The stated objective was to apply an existing suitability mapping tool to tropical forages and produce suitability maps under both current and potential future climate conditions.  The decision context was practical and programmatic: the maps were used by smallholder dairy farmers in East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Ethiopia) to select “context-specific no-regret” forage species and varieties.  The document also implied a research and innovation decision context by asserting that mapped “gaps and opportunities” could be translated into breeding objectives for forage breeding programmes. 

Analytically, the decision support intent appeared to be ex ante targeting and option screening (which species/varieties to promote where), rather than investment optimisation, cost-effectiveness ranking, or policy compliance assessment. This is inferable because the outputs were described as suitability maps and “no-regret” selections, not as spatial investment portfolios, intervention costs, or quantified benefit–cost comparisons. 

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The intervention strategy was centred on improved tropical forages and feeding strategies as an entry point to simultaneously increase livestock productivity and eco-efficiency.  Although not labelled as Nature-based Solutions, the strategy aligned with NbS logic in that it relied on plant-based system redesign (forage species/variety choice) to achieve productivity and environmental resilience outcomes.  The conceptual framing combined mitigation-adjacent objectives (reducing environmental footprints such as GHG emissions and land-use conversion pressures) with adaptation objectives (enhancing resilience of livestock systems under climate change through climate-aligned feed resources).

The document did not specify particular forage species, management practices (e.g., cut-and-carry, grazing regimes), or landscape-scale land-use strategies (e.g., restoration corridors, riparian buffers). Therefore, the NbS practice content remained generic and was presented primarily as species/variety selection guided by spatial suitability. 

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

The spatial framework was described only at a high level. The analysis applied a “suitability mapping tool” implemented as a web-based GIS tool that was “well documented and easy to use” and bundled with a spatial database.  The geographic scope of demonstrated use was East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Ethiopia), while the broader motivation referenced global livestock keepers and climate-vulnerable regions.

Key methodological elements that were *not* specified included the unit of analysis (grid size, administrative units), the suitability modelling approach (e.g., rule-based thresholds vs. statistical niche models), the variable set (temperature/precipitation, soils, altitude, etc.), and how variables were combined (weights, scoring, machine learning, or mechanistic constraints).  The only explicit methodological distinction was scenario framing: suitability maps were produced for both current and “potential future climate conditions.” 

Given the absence of detail, uncertainty treatment could only be inferred as scenario comparison rather than probabilistic uncertainty propagation. The document did not indicate sensitivity analysis, ensemble climate models, or confidence metrics; it only asserted that future climates were considered. 

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The document stated that the tool was packaged with a spatial database, implying the presence of precompiled geospatial inputs, but it did not list dataset types, sources, resolutions, or temporal baselines.  Biophysical, socio-economic, biodiversity, and infrastructure datasets were not explicitly mentioned. Similarly, the climate datasets and scenario definitions underlying “potential future climate conditions” were not described. 

Data limitations were not addressed in the document. In particular, there was no discussion of input uncertainty (climate model divergence, downscaling error), ecological validity (transferability of suitability relationships), or adoption constraints (seed availability, labour, land tenure) that often shape whether suitability translates to realised adoption. 

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

The primary outputs were “suitability maps for a wide array of tropical forages” under current and future climate conditions.  The decision-relevant product was therefore a spatially explicit screening layer supporting forage species/variety choice by smallholders and practitioners, framed explicitly as enabling “no-regret” selections (i.e., options expected to remain suitable across plausible futures). 

The document also claimed an innovation-planning output: maps revealed “gaps and opportunities” to improve and expand adapted forage options, which could inform breeding objectives.  However, the report did not describe any classification scheme (e.g., suitability classes), area statistics, quantified impacts (carbon, productivity, risk reduction), or explicit trade-off analyses among objectives. 

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was central to the analytical justification and was integrated into the mapping exercise through the explicit production of suitability maps under “potential future climate conditions.”  The climate-risk framing treated climate as a driver for targeting forage options—because feed availability was described as a key pathway of climate impacts on livestock—rather than as a separate hazard layer (e.g., drought probability) or as an implementation constraint. 

The analytical treatment of climate hazards, downscaling, scenario selection, or time horizons was not addressed in the document. 

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic analysis (cost-effectiveness, ROI/NPV, or profitability) was not addressed in the document.  Implementation considerations were discussed only indirectly via intended users (students, educators, development practitioners) and reported uptake by smallholder dairy farmers using the maps for selection decisions.  There was no explicit discussion of governance, extension systems, seed supply chains, incentives, or policy integration. 

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Validation approaches were not addressed in the document.  The report asserted that farmers “used these maps” for selection, which indicates application, but it did not provide evidence of outcome validation (e.g., field performance, adoption persistence, productivity gains, resilience outcomes) or robustness checks (e.g., sensitivity to climate assumptions, cross-validation of suitability models).  Methodological limitations and uncertainties were not articulated. 

## 10. Critical Assessment

The document articulated a coherent causal rationale for spatial decision support: if climate impacts on livestock are mediated through feed resources, then forage suitability mapping is a logically consistent adaptation planning instrument.  Its emphasis on a web-based, documented tool packaged with a spatial database suggests attention to usability and dissemination—an important but often underappreciated determinant of whether spatial tools influence practice.  However, analytical transparency was low because the abstract did not specify the suitability modelling logic, variable selection, spatial resolution, or scenario construction, preventing technical appraisal of internal validity and transferability.  Robustness claims implicit in “no-regret” framing were not substantiated with uncertainty analysis, ensemble climate scenarios, or validation results, meaning the decision support could be vulnerable to overconfidence in model outputs.  The linkage from maps to breeding objectives was potentially powerful but methodologically underspecified; without explicit criteria for defining “gaps” (e.g., suitability loss hotspots, underserved agro-ecologies), the breeding translation risked being interpretive rather than evidence-anchored.  Finally, the absence of economic and adoption constraints in the described framework limited its readiness for investment planning, suggesting the tool functioned best as an early-stage option-screening instrument rather than a comprehensive prioritisation model.","NA","NA","NA","Method not described.","Not adressed in paper","NA","NA","Forage suitability maps (current climate; potential future climate); Gaps and opportunities maps for adapted forage options","No","Yes: The authors target forage options as an NbS to both adapt livestock systems to climate change and reduce environmental footprints (mitigation), demonstrated by producing suitability maps for current and potential future climate conditions to inform no-regret, scenario-based selections of forage species/varieties.","No","Multi-country: Kenya;Tanzania;Rwanda;Ethiopia","The NbS practice addressed consisted of improved tropical forages and feeding strategies as a nature-based route to sustainable intensification of East African livestock systems.

---

## 1. Context and Rationale

The toolkit addressed widespread degradation of dryland rangelands across semi-arid and arid regions, particularly in West Asia and North Africa. The document framed degradation as both ecological and institutional. Ecologically, overgrazing, invasive species expansion, and declining productivity had resulted in severe deterioration of ecosystem structure and function, including cases where 50–70% of rangelands were affected by degradation . In Uzbekistan alone, more than 60% of rangelands were reported degraded .

Institutionally, the weakening of traditional governance systems—such as the hima system—was identified as a major driver of degradation . The document emphasized that degradation was not solely the result of technical mismanagement but also of declining participatory governance and erosion of communal tenure arrangements .

The rationale for intervention was therefore dual: to restore ecological integrity and to re-establish effective governance systems that support resilient pastoral production systems. The toolkit positioned sustainable rangeland management (SRM) as a prerequisite for maintaining ecosystem services, livestock productivity, and pastoral livelihoods under conditions of climate change and socio-economic transition.

---

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The toolkit aimed to consolidate state-of-the-art knowledge on sustainable rangeland management practices and integrate them into a holistic framework . It explicitly responded to the observation that most projects focused on single interventions and lacked integrated planning .

The decision context was primarily operational and landscape-scale. The toolkit supported:

* Development of participatory rangeland management plans
* Selection of restoration interventions appropriate to degradation stage
* Governance strengthening and tenure clarification
* Monitoring and adaptive management

Unlike optimization-based spatial prioritization tools, the toolkit supported decentralized, community-based planning processes rather than top-down investment targeting.

The document framed sustainable rangeland management as a Nature-based Solution integrating restoration, climate adaptation, and livelihood resilience. Practices included:

* Grazing exclusion and resting
* Rotational grazing and carrying capacity assessment 
* Direct seeding
* Shrub and tree plantation
* Water harvesting techniques 
* Soil surface scarification
* Participatory rangeland governance (including hima systems) 

The hima system was presented as a traditional governance-based NbS, integrating biodiversity conservation and sustainable use . Restoration was conceptualized as both ecological rehabilitation and institutional transformation.

The intervention framework recognized thresholds of irreversibility, recommending grazing exclusion as a first-aid measure to prevent further degradation .

---

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

### Spatial Scale and Unit of Analysis

The toolkit operated at landscape scale, recognizing that rangeland management units may span thousands of square kilometers and involve shared rights among thousands of households . It cautioned against imposing village-level participatory tools onto large-scale systems without adaptation.

The unit of analysis was context-dependent, typically defined through participatory mapping and landscape-level assessment rather than fixed grid units.

### Modelling and Prioritization Logic

The framework was procedural rather than algorithmic. It followed a staged process:

1. Baseline assessment (biophysical, socio-economic, governance) 
2. Participatory mapping of current and future states 
3. Governance strengthening and action planning 
4. Adaptive management cycle: monitor → assess → define problem → adjust → implement 

The DPSIR (Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, Response) framework structured assessment logic .

No explicit quantitative weighting or optimization models were presented. Instead, consensus-building and negotiated prioritization guided intervention selection.

### Treatment of Uncertainty

Uncertainty was addressed qualitatively. Climate projections and ecological thresholds were acknowledged , but no probabilistic modelling or scenario simulation was included.

---

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The toolkit integrated multiple data categories:

* Biophysical: vegetation cover, soil conditions, land productivity, remote sensing imagery 
* Climate data 
* Socio-economic: livestock numbers, herd sizes, feed calendars, subsidies 
* Governance: tenure type, stakeholder rights, institutional arrangements 

Data collection increasingly used geolocated mobile tools .

Data limitations were acknowledged explicitly in case studies, with several parameters listed as “Not available” , indicating incomplete socio-economic datasets.

---

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

Outputs included:

* Baseline maps of rangeland condition
* Participatory maps of current and desired future states 
* Grazing management plans and rotational schemes 
* Carrying capacity calculations 
* Restoration strategy frameworks 

The outputs were not spatial prioritization rankings but structured planning artifacts supporting collective action and monitoring.

Quantified ecosystem service metrics (e.g., carbon sequestration values) were not calculated explicitly in the sections reviewed.

---

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was integrated primarily through:

* Interpretation of assessment results through projected climate trends 
* Recognition of increased severity of weather events and water scarcity 
* Framing of SRM as adaptation to global change 

Climate acted as both a driver of degradation and a contextual variable in restoration planning. However, no formal climate scenario modelling was undertaken.

---

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic dimensions were discussed in terms of:

* Need for increased investment in SRM 
* Recognition of ecosystem goods and services valuation 
* Subsidy structures in livestock production systems 

No cost-effectiveness modelling, NPV analysis, or ROI estimation was provided. Economic feasibility was treated institutionally rather than quantitatively.

Implementation logic emphasized:

* Participatory governance
* Clarification of rights and responsibilities 
* Institutional validation processes 
* Monitoring governance changes using methods such as “Most Significant Change” 

---

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Validation was embedded in participatory feedback loops . Community validation workshops reviewed findings and refined action plans.

Monitoring incorporated vegetation and soil indicators and governance performance .

Limitations included:

* Incomplete datasets in case studies 
* Lack of quantitative predictive modelling
* Absence of economic optimization

Robustness derived primarily from iterative, adaptive management rather than statistical validation.

---

## 10. Critical Assessment

Methodologically, the toolkit was strong in integrating ecological restoration with governance reform and participatory planning. Its staged, adaptive framework was coherent and grounded in established ecological concepts (e.g., thresholds, carrying capacity, DPSIR). Analytical transparency was high in process design but limited in quantitative modelling. The absence of spatial optimization, cost-effectiveness analysis, and explicit ecosystem service valuation constrained its utility for national-scale investment prioritization. Climate change integration remained qualitative rather than model-based. The approach was highly transferable to similar pastoral drylands but required substantial institutional capacity and facilitation skills. Overall, the toolkit was robust as a participatory planning instrument but not as a predictive or economic decision-support model.","hima systems","Vegetation cover (Biophysical); Soil conditions (Biophysical); Land productivity (Biophysical); Remote sensing imagery (Biophysical); Climate data (Climate data); Livestock numbers (Socio-economic); Herd sizes (Socio-economic); Feed calendars (Socio-economic); Subsidies (Socio-economic); Tenure type (Governance); Stakeholder rights (Governance); Institutional arrangements (Governance)","NA","Participatory mapping of current and desired future states at landscape scale, informed by a DPSIR-based baseline assessment and negotiated, consensus-driven prioritization rather than quantitative optimization.","Participatory feedback loops; Community validation workshops; Monitoring of vegetation and soil indicators and governance performance.","NA","NA","Baseline rangeland-condition map; Participatory maps of current and desired future states","No","No","No","Multi-country: West Asia;North Africa;Uzbekistan","NbS addressed: sustainable rangeland management framed as a Nature-based Solution for restoration, adaptation and livelihoods, including grazing exclusion/resting, rotational grazing and direct seeding.

## 1. Context and Rationale

The document responded to a recurrent operational problem in pastoral and agro-pastoral development: conventional land-use planning and natural resource management interventions often proceeded with limited understanding of rangeland resource distribution, seasonal access patterns, and multi-user governance arrangements. The guide framed participatory resource mapping as a research and facilitation technique that enabled communities to collectively “reveal and analyze issues” and produce community-led solutions, particularly where multiple livelihood groups and resource users interacted across shared landscapes. 

The rationale was explicitly institutional as well as ecological. The guide positioned mapping as central to Participatory Rangeland Management (PRM), where mapping occurred during an initial “investigation” stage and then supported subsequent “negotiation” and “implementation” stages that relied on maps to develop agreements for practical resource management.  The document therefore implied that the critical deficit was not only spatial information, but also structured dialogue mechanisms capable of surfacing competing claims, power imbalances, and resource conflicts before they escalated. It further argued that mapping could serve as a baseline for preparedness and could help facilitate climate change adaptation, although it did not formalize adaptation metrics. 

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The guide’s objective was practical: to provide step-by-step instructions and checklists enabling a mapping team to implement a participatory mapping exercise in the field, structured into three stages—preparation, facilitation, and validation—each subdivided into three steps.  It clarified that mapping could support multiple decision contexts, including PRM processes and other planning processes such as planning public works. 

The implied decisions supported were local to meso-scale governance and programming decisions: identifying and categorizing key natural resources; locating “productivity hotspots”; understanding patterns of mobility; diagnosing resource condition and priority areas for protection; clarifying land uses and user groups and where conflicts might arise.  Rather than producing a technical prioritization portfolio, the guide supported decisions about negotiation agendas, community management planning priorities, and coordination among development actors operating in the same geography.

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The document did not frame interventions in Nature-based Solutions language and did not specify ecological restoration or engineered NbS options. The “intervention strategy” was instead methodological: enabling PRM by producing participatory rangeland resource maps that would become negotiating tools for improving management practices and community agreements. 

Nevertheless, the practice set implied by mapping outputs aligned with NbS logic insofar as mapped features included grazing areas, drought reserves, productivity hotspots, and resource condition—elements that typically underpin rangeland conservation, rotational grazing design, drought planning, and conflict mitigation.  The guide’s emphasis remained on the enabling conditions for any NbS-like rangeland intervention: negotiated rules, inclusive participation, and locally legitimate spatial knowledge.

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

The spatial framework was community-defined rather than technically standardized. The unit of analysis was not a fixed grid or administrative polygon; it was the landscape as represented through a ground-based mapping exercise using locally available materials (ash, leaves, sticks, stones, charcoal, etc.) to depict features and boundaries.  The guide explicitly cautioned against beginning with administrative boundaries (e.g., woreda/kebele), arguing that pastoralists’ seasonal and reciprocal rights often extend beyond such boundaries and that forcing administrative delineations could truncate the true resource system under management.  This was a substantive methodological choice: the spatial logic prioritized functional resource geographies over bureaucratic geometries, with boundary discussions deferred to later and recommended to be negotiated with neighboring communities. 

The “modelling” logic was qualitative and facilitative. Spatial accuracy emerged from iterative elicitation, triangulation among user groups, and subsequent validation meetings. The guide prescribed starting from reference features (rivers, mountains, roads, settlements, forests) and then mapping key resources relative to these anchors to support orientation and approximate scaling.  It further suggested sequencing contributions by user group (e.g., prompting women on dry-season resource use, or camel herders on wet-season movements), indicating an analytic commitment to capturing heterogeneity and seasonality rather than a single “average” system. 

Variable selection was purpose-driven: the guide required mapping teams to clarify objectives in advance and then select mapped features accordingly.  It recommended adding detail either on the same map or on additional maps if clutter risked reducing interpretability.  No weighting, scoring, optimization, or formal scenario analysis was described. Treatment of uncertainty was embedded procedurally—through careful note-taking of disagreements and multiple perspectives—rather than through quantitative uncertainty bounds. 

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The evidence base was community knowledge elicited through structured dialogue, augmented by field observation and (optionally) later digitization or cross-checking using topographic maps, GPS, or GIS imagery.  The guide treated the mapping conversation itself as critical data, requiring a dedicated note taker to document discussion flow, quotations, participation balance across gender and interest groups, and signs of underlying tensions. 

Mapped datasets (in the conventional sense) were not specified; instead the guide listed potential thematic features, spanning biophysical (wet/dry season grazing areas, drought reserves, “hot spots,” insect infestation areas), infrastructure/services (veterinary posts, health posts, schools, markets), and socio-political risk layers (areas of conflict, livestock theft risk).  The document acknowledged implicit limitations by warning that participatory mapping was not systematic and that mapped features may not reflect exact locations, thus requiring further work for planning and management uses. 

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

The principal outputs were (i) a validated hand-drawn rangeland resource map (with legend, date, location, north arrow, and participant/mapping team names) and (ii) a written rangeland mapping report documenting purposes, site details, a copy of the map, structured notes of discussions, disputes and their resolution, participation assessment, and recommended next steps.   These products were designed to support negotiation and agreement-making by providing an auditable narrative of how mapped claims were produced and contested, not merely a cartographic artifact.

The guide also described dissemination outputs: laminated scale copies for community leaders and institutions, with wider distribution (subject to community approval) to participants, local government offices, NGOs, and research institutes.  This created a decision-relevant product chain: maps were treated as governance objects that could coordinate actors, support advocacy, and enable comparison with other maps if digitized—while cautioning against digitization displacing community ownership. 

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was mentioned as an application domain—mapping could facilitate climate change adaptation—yet it was not operationalized through climate hazard layers, projections, or quantitative risk metrics.  Risk was incorporated more concretely through mapping of drought grazing areas/reserves, conflict zones, livestock theft risk, and insect infestation areas, which functioned as locally defined risk surfaces influencing management decisions.  The analytical treatment of risk was therefore participatory and categorical, with risk identification emerging from dialogue rather than from probabilistic modelling.

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Formal economic analysis (cost-effectiveness, ROI, NPV) was not addressed. Implementation considerations were instead treated as governance and process constraints: the guide emphasized building trust, ensuring inclusion of diverse stakeholders (including neighboring pastoralists with reciprocal grazing rights and settlement residents using rangeland resources), and managing power imbalances that could bias outputs and exacerbate tensions. 

The document explicitly noted implementation trade-offs in government involvement: woreda representatives could attend as observers, but their presence might lead to under-reporting of sensitive issues such as illegal tree cutting, indicating awareness of strategic misreporting risks and the need to safeguard participants.  Ownership and consent over map use were treated as core implementation conditions, including caution about advocacy uses and the need for follow-up agreements for alternative uses. 

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

The guide placed disproportionate methodological weight on validation as the main robustness mechanism. It prescribed a multi-step validation process: initial review by the original mapping group, then presentation to the wider community and external stakeholders (including woreda administration) as observers, and finally reconvening to produce an adjusted, validated hand-drawn map.  It advised dispute resolution via sub-group meetings and site visits at disputed locations, with careful documentation of differing viewpoints. 

A further robustness provision was optional “ground truthing,” where mapping teams could cross-check participatory maps against topographic maps, GPS, or GIS imagery, explicitly acknowledging that participatory mapping was not systematic and may need refinement for planning.  The document therefore recognized epistemic limits of elicited spatial knowledge but offered procedural triangulation rather than statistical validation.

## 10. Critical Assessment

The guide’s methodological strength lay in its explicit process architecture: it treated participatory mapping as both data generation and conflict-sensitive facilitation, embedding roles (facilitator, note taker, map copier) and safeguards for inclusivity and bias management.  Its analytical transparency was high at the procedural level but limited at the technical-geospatial level, because it did not define standards for spatial accuracy, scale, or digitization protocols beyond general cautions.  Robustness depended heavily on social validation and negotiated agreement, which is appropriate for common-property rangelands but also vulnerable to elite capture if participation safeguards fail.   The document correctly identified strategic reporting risks when government observers are present, but it did not offer technical countermeasures (e.g., anonymized reporting, independent ecological verification) beyond process guidance.  Scalability is plausible as a replicable toolkit, but transferability across contexts depends on facilitation capacity and the ability to manage cross-boundary rights without reverting to administrative simplifications that the guide explicitly warned against.","rotational grazing design; drought planning","Rivers (reference features via community-defined mapping); Mountains (reference features via community-defined mapping); Roads (reference features via community-defined mapping); Settlements (reference features via community-defined mapping); Forests (reference features via community-defined mapping); Wet/dry season grazing areas (biophysical features via participatory mapping); Drought reserves (biophysical features via participatory mapping); Hot spots (biophysical features via participatory mapping); Insect infestation areas (biophysical features via participatory mapping); Veterinary posts (infrastructure/services via participatory mapping); Health posts (infrastructure/services via participatory mapping); Schools (infrastructure/services via participatory mapping); Markets (infrastructure/services via participatory mapping); Areas of conflict (socio-political risk layers via participatory mapping); Livestock theft risk (socio-political risk layers via participatory mapping)","NA","Qualitative, participatory ground-based mapping with community-defined landscape units, anchored to reference features, using iterative elicitation and triangulation across user groups and validation meetings to identify productivity hotspots, grazing areas, drought reserves, and protection-priority areas (no weighting, scoring, or formal modelling).","Multi-step validation: initial review by the original mapping group; presentation to the wider community and external stakeholders (including woreda administration) as observers; reconvening to produce an adjusted, validated hand-drawn map; dispute resolution via sub-group meetings and site visits at disputed locations with careful documentation of differing viewpoints; optional ground-truthing by cross-checking participatory maps against topographic maps, GPS, or GIS imagery.","NA","NA","Validated hand-drawn rangeland resource map (grazing areas, drought reserves, productivity hotspots, insect infestation areas, conflict zones)","Yes: climate change is framed as an application domain, and climate-related hazards such as drought, pests, and conflict areas are treated as risk surfaces that influence NbS management decisions.

Context and Rationale

The document was framed around the practical problem that Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) planning frequently proceeded with incomplete, non-comparable, or non-spatially explicit information about climate risk drivers and where EbA could be most effective. It therefore treated “climate risk assessment in the context of EbA” as a response to an “information gap” that constrained decision processes and stakeholder expectations, rather than as an academic exercise.  The rationale relied on the IPCC AR5 risk framing—hazard, exposure, and vulnerability in a social-ecological system (SES)—and asserted that making these components explicit in a causal structure (impact chains) created actionable “entry points” for adaptation practitioners, including EbA measures.  The logic was that EbA measures could not be defensibly prioritised without first articulating the cause–effect pathways linking climate signals to impacts and to modifiable vulnerability factors, and then translating these pathways into indicators that could be mapped and compared. 

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The document’s explicit objective was to guide users through a modular workflow that could (i) develop impact chains, (ii) quantify and spatially compare risk components and overall risk, and (iii) use these outputs to support identification and spatial planning of EbA options.  It also positioned quantification as essential when the decision context required comparisons across places or the creation of baselines suitable for monitoring and evaluation (M&E): qualitative impact chains alone were described as potentially sufficient only for high-level identification of measures, whereas M&E or comparative decisions required continuing through indicator selection and quantification.  In decision terms, the workflow was designed to support prioritisation and targeting (where risk and its drivers were highest), communication to stakeholders (how risk arose and which components dominated), and planning of adaptation strategies that included EbA alongside conventional measures. 

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

EbA was operationalised as interventions that reduced risk by acting on vulnerability (and sometimes exposure) through ecosystem condition and ecosystem services. In the worked flooding example, the impact chain explicitly linked ecosystem degradation (e.g., wetlands and forests) to reduced regulating services (e.g., natural retention capacity, erosion protection), thereby justifying restoration-oriented measures as adaptation actions rather than purely conservation activities.  The document’s EbA option set in that example included wetland restoration, retention ponds, riparian zone restoration, afforestation/reforestation, and buffer strips along rivers.  Notably, the same table juxtaposed these with “conventional” or enabling options (capacity building, livelihood diversification, communication and awareness), implying a mixed adaptation portfolio and signalling that ecosystem measures were not assumed sufficient on their own.  The broader conceptual positioning of EbA within a “mainstreaming cycle” and an annex on qualification criteria suggested an intent to align measures with quality standards, but the retrieved sections did not provide the full criteria content. 

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

The analytical core was a stepwise construction from causal model to composite index. First, impact chains were built iteratively through a participatory process that incorporated expert/local knowledge and required disciplined factor allocation to avoid double counting and to preserve (as far as possible) independence across risk components.   Second, indicators were selected to quantify factors for hazard, exposure, and vulnerability; “good indicators” were required to be directionally clear, affordable, and phrased relative to a “critical state,” consistent with the AR5 framing.  Hazard indicators were recommended to be intensity or frequency measures tied to thresholds (e.g., days above a precipitation threshold), reinforcing that the method hinged on explicit threshold-setting rather than purely statistical normalisation.  Intermediate impacts were treated as explanatory constructs and were explicitly excluded from aggregation to overall risk, which was methodologically important because it prevented “pathway” variables from being double-counted as components of risk. 
Third, indicator datasets were normalised to a unit-less 0–1 range, where 0 denoted “optimal” and 1 denoted “critical,” enabling cross-indicator aggregation.  Fourth, indicators were aggregated (with optional weighting) into the three risk components and then further aggregated into a composite “risk indicator” using a weighted arithmetic mean structure.   In the application example, equal weights were applied and weighting was not used, underscoring a simplifying assumption that component contributions were commensurate and that stakeholder value judgements were either absent or deferred. 

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The evidence base was described as multi-domain and spatially explicit: baseline geographic/environmental data (administrative boundaries, land use, water bodies, soils, salinity extent/levels), socio-economic datasets (census, poverty, education), and hazard data from local weather stations were assembled to populate indicators.  Data sources spanned meteorological offices, statistics offices, ministries/municipalities, research institutes/universities, and public data portals including satellite imagery repositories, indicating a pragmatic, mixed-provenance approach typical of applied risk assessments.  The document acknowledged temporal and spatial limitations: collecting district-level data “not older than two years” was described as challenging, and key socio-economic inputs (e.g., census) were noted as updated at multi-year intervals, which implied that risk maps could embed lagged vulnerability patterns.  The emphasis on georeferenced datasets (pixel-based or administrative-area referenced) reinforced that the methodology depended on spatial compatibility across layers; where inputs were coarser or outdated, the composite outputs risked false precision. 

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

Outputs were designed to be both map-based and diagnostic. The method produced numeric values (0–1) for hazard, vulnerability, exposure, and overall risk, each spatially referenced (illustrated at district level), enabling inter-district comparison and prioritisation.  Composite risk values were then translated into risk classes using explicit thresholds (e.g., 0–0.2 “very low” through >0.8–1 “very high”), thereby creating a categorical product for communication and screening decisions.  The application example reported district-level risk scores and presented an “aggregated risk index” map, indicating that cartographic products were a central decision interface.  The guidance also stressed presenting both aggregated results and underlying datasets so decision-makers could identify key drivers (e.g., when exposure dominated risk), which was a critical design choice to avoid treating the composite index as a black box. 

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was operationalised primarily through the “hazard” component as climate signals expressed via threshold-based frequency/intensity indicators (e.g., extreme precipitation days), rather than through explicit future climate scenarios in the retrieved sections.  The hazard–impact logic was elaborated via intermediate impacts (e.g., high water levels, erosion, sediment deposition) that were treated as a function of hazard and vulnerability, clarifying that climate signals alone were insufficient to explain outcomes.  The framework therefore treated climate hazards as drivers for targeting (through mapped hazard intensity/frequency) and treated vulnerability as the principal locus for adaptation action, including ecosystem service restoration.  Not addressed in the document (in the retrieved sections): explicit use of future climate projections or scenario ensembles in the quantitative workflow.

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Implementation was approached procedurally through stakeholder involvement and audience-oriented reporting rather than through explicit cost-effectiveness modelling. The workflow specified that workshops with experts and relevant actors should support preparation, indicator selection, and strategy development, indicating an implementation logic grounded in participatory substantiation and transparency.   The reporting module stated that outputs should be packaged in an assessment report describing objectives, methods, data collection, and calculations, implying an accountability mechanism for institutional uptake.  Economic appraisal (ROI/NPV), explicit feasibility filters, and financing mechanisms were not addressed in the retrieved sections.

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

The main explicit robustness discussion concerned aggregation behaviour. The document flagged that arithmetic mean aggregation was simple but could “conceal” critical issues when a high value in one component was offset by a low value in another, which was a substantive limitation for risk governance because it could under-prioritise places with extreme vulnerability but moderate hazard (or vice versa).  Weighting was presented as technically easy to introduce (via the weighted mean equation) but was not applied in the example, leaving sensitivity of results to weights largely untested within the demonstrated workflow.  Data recency constraints and uneven update intervals were also acknowledged as a limitation that could affect baseline accuracy and trend detection.  Not addressed in the document (in the retrieved sections): formal validation against observed impact data, systematic uncertainty propagation, or quantitative sensitivity analysis across thresholds and indicator choices.

## 10. Critical Assessment

Methodologically, the document’s strongest contribution was the explicit coupling of an AR5-consistent causal model (impact chains) with a reproducible indicator normalisation and aggregation pipeline, which improved traceability from conceptual risk drivers to mapped outputs.   Analytical transparency was comparatively high where it required critical-state phrasing, threshold definition, and explicit exclusion of intermediate impacts from aggregation, reducing common pathway double-counting errors.  However, robustness of conclusions was potentially weakened by reliance on equal weights in the worked example and by the acknowledged masking effect of arithmetic means, which could distort prioritisation in heterogeneous SES contexts.   The approach also risked conveying spurious precision when district-level socio-economic indicators were temporally lagged, yet combined with finer-resolution biophysical layers, without an explicit uncertainty treatment.  Transferability was plausible because the workflow was modular and data-source agnostic, but scalability depended on institutional capacity to define thresholds credibly and to maintain georeferenced datasets across domains; these are non-trivial constraints in many planning contexts.","wetland restoration; retention ponds; riparian zone restoration; afforestation/reforestation; buffer strips along rivers","Administrative boundaries (Public data portals); Land use (Satellite imagery repositories); Water bodies (Satellite imagery repositories); Soils (Public data portals); Salinity extent/levels (Public data portals); Census (Statistics offices); Poverty (Statistics offices); Education (Statistics offices); Hazard data (Meteorological offices)","district-level","A participatory impact-chain framework coupled with a spatial multi-indicator risk assessment: select hazard, exposure and vulnerability indicators, normalise to a 0–1 scale, optionally weight, aggregate into three risk components and then a composite risk index with a weighted mean, apply explicit thresholds to classify risk, and map district-level priority areas for EbA targeting.","Not adressed in paper","NA","NA","Aggregated risk index map (Very low, Low, Moderate, High, Very High)","No","Yes: NbS (EbA options) are targeted in areas with high hazard and overall risk to reduce climate-related vulnerability and exposure through ecosystem restoration and services.

**Chazdon, R.L. and Guariguata, M.R. (2018). Decision Support Tools for Forest Landscape Restoration: Current Status and Future Outlook.**

---

## 1. Context and Rationale

The document addressed the growing global commitment to Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) as a strategy to reconcile ecological integrity with human well-being across degraded landscapes. FLR was framed as a response to the limitations of both small-scale ecological restoration and large-scale monoculture forestry, which historically failed to balance ecological functionality and socio-economic needs . The report situated FLR within a broader landscape approach defined as a long-term collaborative process to balance multiple, often conflicting objectives .

The authors argued that the complexity of FLR planning exceeded traditional ecosystem-focused approaches and required integration of spatially explicit information layers to guide prioritization and reduce costs while delivering equitable benefits . The rationale for decision-support tools stemmed from the need to allocate limited financial resources efficiently and to achieve scale in restoration efforts .

Thus, the problem addressed was not ecological restoration per se, but the methodological and institutional challenge of systematically planning restoration across heterogeneous landscapes under financial, social, and policy constraints.

---

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The primary objective of the report was to review and synthesize existing decision-support tools applicable to FLR, evaluate their strengths and limitations, and outline future directions. The review included tools for spatial prioritization, ecosystem service assessment, economic modeling, and species selection .

The decision context was multi-scalar, encompassing national restoration strategies, sub-national prioritization, and site-level intervention planning. The tools reviewed aimed to support:

* Spatial prioritization of restoration areas 
* Evaluation of cost-effectiveness and trade-offs 
* Identification of synergies among ecosystem services 
* Alignment of restoration with national priorities and stakeholder needs 

The review explicitly addressed the question “Tools for what and for whom?” , highlighting that decision-support systems must be tailored to specific users and policy contexts.

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The report framed FLR as a Nature-based Solution integrating ecological restoration, biodiversity conservation, watershed protection, agroforestry, and climate mitigation . Restoration interventions included:

* Tree planting and agroforestry plantations
* Watershed protection in upland systems
* Silvicultural plantations in lowlands
* Corridor creation and natural regeneration in fragmented landscapes 

FLR was explicitly conceptualized as an integrated land-use planning exercise rather than tree planting alone . It sought to maximize multiple ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, water quality, biodiversity, and socio-economic benefits.

---

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

### Spatial Scale and Unit of Analysis

The tools reviewed operated across spatial scales, from national assessments (e.g., ROAM applications in Ghana, Mexico, Rwanda, Guatemala)  to watershed and sub-national prioritization maps (e.g., Guatemala ROAM map) .

Units of analysis varied depending on tool architecture, typically raster-based grid cells or landscape parcels.

### Modelling and Prioritization Logic

The report reviewed both multi-criteria analysis and optimization-based approaches. It noted that tools like Marxan optimize spatial allocation for biodiversity targets , while emerging FLR tools incorporate cost-effectiveness and ecosystem service trade-offs .

For example, ROOT (Restoration Opportunities Optimization Tool) was designed to optimize spatially explicit ecosystem service delivery to specific beneficiaries . It moved beyond qualitative hotspot overlays to quantitative optimization .

ROAM followed a phased approach integrating spatial mapping, economic modeling, carbon modeling, stakeholder prioritization, and validation .

The analytical logic across tools involved:

* Overlaying biophysical and socio-economic spatial layers
* Assessing trade-offs and synergies among objectives
* Evaluating restoration costs and benefits
* Prioritizing interventions under resource constraints

Uncertainty was addressed through stakeholder validation workshops and iterative assumption testing in ROAM , though quantitative uncertainty modeling was not a central feature.

---

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The tools relied on multiple spatial datasets, including:

* Carbon accrual curves 
* Ecosystem service delivery maps (carbon, water, biodiversity, opportunity cost) 
* Restoration cost components and cost modeling factors 

In ROOT case studies, standardized geospatial datasets were used to model ecosystem services and beneficiary distributions .

The review acknowledged that data gaps, scale mismatches, and outdated assumptions frequently challenge assessments .

---

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

Outputs included:

* National restoration opportunity maps 
* Multi-criteria priority maps 
* Efficiency frontiers showing optimal restoration allocation 
* Maps under alternative social-ecological scenarios 

ROOT case studies quantified cost savings (e.g., 13–95% cost reductions under multi-service approaches in Colombia)  and optimized restoration placement to maximize ecosystem service provision .

These outputs directly informed national strategies, climate mitigation planning, and water quality investments .

---

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate mitigation was integrated as a restoration objective, particularly through carbon modeling and mitigation-oriented prioritization . FLR was linked to REDD and national climate commitments .

Climate acted as a driver for restoration targeting but was not systematically modeled as a risk-based constraint within all tools. Scenario analysis under alternative social-ecological futures was included in some cases .

---

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Cost-effectiveness was emphasized as essential given limited funding . Tools integrated:

* Economic cost modeling and cost-benefit-carbon modeling 
* Opportunity cost mapping 
* ROI considerations 

Validation workshops assessed political and institutional feasibility .

Implementation logic stressed stakeholder engagement, cross-ministerial coordination, and alignment with national policy .

---

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

ROAM incorporated validation workshops to test assumptions and refine outputs . Pilot applications tested applicability across biomes and data conditions .

The review acknowledged that tools differ in capacity to address complexity, and that no single blueprint exists .

Limitations included data gaps, insufficient integration of social dynamics in some tools, and challenges operationalizing FLR at scale .

## 10. Critical Assessment

The review provided a rigorous synthesis of decision-support tools, clearly articulating their theoretical foundations and practical applications. Its major strength lay in clarifying the link between spatial prioritization, ecosystem services, and policy implementation. The emphasis on cost-effectiveness and multi-benefit optimization enhanced practical relevance. However, analytical transparency varied across tools reviewed, and quantitative uncertainty treatment was limited. The report occasionally conflated mapping capacity with decision quality, underestimating governance and political economy constraints. While the scalability of optimization tools was promising, institutional readiness remained a critical bottleneck. Overall, the document offered a technically robust but cautiously optimistic assessment of decision-support tools for FLR.","Tree planting; agroforestry plantations; Watershed protection in upland systems; Silvicultural plantations in lowlands; Corridor creation; natural regeneration","Carbon accrual curves (ROOT); Ecosystem service delivery maps (carbon, water, biodiversity, opportunity cost) (ROOT); Restoration cost components and cost modeling factors (ROOT); Beneficiary distributions (ROOT); Standardized spatial data for ecosystem services and beneficiary distributions (ROOT); Biophysical factors (ROAM); Socio-economic factors (ROAM)","NA","Overlaying biophysical and socio-economic spatial layers; multi-criteria analysis; optimization-based prioritization using tools such as Marxan and ROOT to maximize ecosystem service delivery and cost-effectiveness under resource constraints.","Validation workshops to test assumptions and refine outputs; pilot applications tested applicability across biomes and data conditions; stakeholder validation workshops; iterative assumption testing in ROAM","Marxan (https://marxan.org/); ROAM (https://worldbank.org/en/topic/environment/brief/restoration-opportunity-assessment-method-roam); ROOT (https://root.tools/)","Marxan: an optimization-based tool used to optimize spatial allocation for biodiversity targets within FLR, enabling prioritization under resource constraints; ROAM: a phased spatial-economic-carbon modeling framework that integrates mapping, stakeholder prioritization, and validation to produce national and sub-national restoration opportunity maps and inform prioritization; ROOT: an optimization tool designed to optimize spatially explicit ecosystem service delivery to beneficiaries, moving beyond qualitative hotspot overlays to quantitative optimization and producing outputs such as efficiency frontiers and optimized restoration placement.","National restoration opportunity maps; Multi-criteria priority maps; Efficiency frontiers showing optimal restoration allocation; Maps under alternative social-ecological scenarios","No","Yes: They explicitly treat climate change as a driver for NbS targeting by integrating carbon modeling and mitigation-oriented prioritization, producing outputs like national restoration opportunity maps and scenario-based maps linked to REDD and climate commitments to demonstrate potential climate mitigation benefits.","Yes: Details The OUTPUT analysis includes economic outputs such as quantified cost savings (e.g., 13–95% cost reductions with multi-service approaches in Colombia) and optimized restoration allocation to maximize ecosystem service delivery; it also reflects economic framing through cost-effectiveness, ROI considerations, and cost-benefit–carbon modeling integrated into the outputs (e.g., efficiency frontiers and scenario maps), indicating economic viability alongside ecological trade-offs.","National: Ghana;Mexico;Rwanda;Guatemala;Colombia | Sub-national: Guatemala","FLR was treated as a Nature-based Solution integrating tree planting/agroforestry, watershed protection, and corridor creation to maximize carbon sequestration, water quality, biodiversity, and socio-economic benefits.

Context and Rationale

The document addressed a recurrent implementation gap in wetland conservation and compensatory mitigation: decisions about where to preserve or restore wetlands were often made site-by-site without a defensible watershed context, making it difficult to compare projects in terms of ecosystem-service returns and to align mitigation outcomes with broader watershed sustainability goals. The report positioned wetlands as “natural infrastructure” that underpinned public benefits such as water-quality protection, flood damage reduction, and water supply, while also supporting biodiversity, and argued that these benefits varied strongly with landscape position, hydrologic connectivity, and surrounding land use.  

The intervention rationale was explicitly regulatory as well as voluntary. It was framed as a response to the 2008 Federal Mitigation Rule under Clean Water Act §404, which emphasized watershed-based compensatory mitigation planning grounded in watershed needs and lost ecosystem services, not solely wetland area. The report asserted that a watershed approach could also link regulatory mitigation with non-regulatory conservation investments to achieve benefits beyond compliance.  

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The study’s explicit objective was to provide an analytical “watershed approach” for statewide wetland preservation and restoration in Wisconsin through a web-based decision support system (the Wetlands and Watersheds Explorer) that (i) ranked watersheds by ecosystem-service decline attributable to historical wetland loss and (ii) prioritized current wetlands and potentially restorable wetlands as candidate sites for meeting those watershed-level needs.  

The intended decisions were multi-sectoral: siting and screening of compensatory mitigation projects and mitigation banking; guiding investments by the Wisconsin Wetland Conservation Trust and the state in-lieu fee program; siting “public natural infrastructure” and green infrastructure projects; and informing watershed, wildlife, and water-quality planning and conservation resource allocation. The document was explicit that the Explorer did not pre-authorize or “pre-select” sites; it narrowed options to a manageable subset for subsequent field-based feasibility and design work and did not imply regulatory approval.  

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The intervention strategy was framed as wetland-based nature-based solutions with a primary focus on *preservation* of existing wetlands and *re-establishment* of former wetlands (restoration of wetlands converted to upland). These were treated as the actionable “sites” in the analysis. Wetland creation and enhancement were excluded because the document argued they required on-the-ground evaluation and trade-off analysis not consistently supported by available statewide GIS layers. Rehabilitation (improving degraded current wetlands) was acknowledged as important but was not operationalized in the tool due to data constraints; it was presented as a future improvement area.  

Conceptually, the NbS framing combined adaptation (flood mitigation and water-quality protection) and mitigation co-benefits (carbon storage), while also including habitat outcomes for fish/aquatic life, wildlife guilds, and plant community integrity. 

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

The geographic scope was statewide Wisconsin. Spatial planning operated across nested watershed units, organized from large river basins (6-digit hydrologic units) down through smaller hydrologic units (8-, 10-, and 12-digit units), enabling comparisons across multiple planning scales.  

Methodologically, the framework combined three linked steps: (1) watershed assessment of relative ecosystem-service decline attributable to historical wetland loss; (2) within-watershed site prioritization of current and potentially restorable wetlands by ecosystem-service potential; and (3) a wildlife habitat assessment layer/tool to refine site evaluation.  

The prioritisation logic was not an optimisation model; it was a structured, criteria-based ranking system. At the watershed level, five services were assessed—flood abatement, fish and aquatic habitat, sediment reduction, nutrient transformation, and surface water supply—selected because they were relevant to land-use decisions, assessable via GIS, and meaningfully linked to watershed-scale factors; other services (e.g., shoreline protection, carbon storage, wildlife habitat) were excluded from watershed-scale ranking due to site specificity or scale mismatch.  

At the site level, nine services were assessed (including shoreline protection, carbon storage, and floristic integrity) because site-context variables and land-use condition could be incorporated at finer resolution. Service potential was determined through GISRAM, described as a Level 1 analogue of Wisconsin’s field-based rapid method (WWRAMv2), translating expert-defined “opportunity, effectiveness, and social significance” factors into GIS queries and assigning qualitative ranks relative to other sites in the same watershed. The document emphasized qualitative ranking (e.g., low/moderate/high or “very high”) rather than continuous scoring, and noted that potentially restorable wetland scoring was constrained where restoration plans (e.g., vegetation/hydrologic regime) were unknown.  

For the watershed needs assessment (historic vs current service potential), the report relied on a Wetlands Watershed Assessment Layer (WWAL) built from LLWW (landscape position, landform, water flow path, waterbody type) classifications and expert-derived ecosystem-service correlation tables linking LLWW classes to service levels, thereby inferring pre-settlement service provision and quantifying relative loss. 

Uncertainty was treated implicitly through repeated cautions about remotely sensed data and scale: watershed-scale results were necessary for context but low precision for site design; the Explorer was framed as a screening tool requiring field verification and local data integration.  

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The evidence base consisted primarily of statewide geospatial datasets integrated in a GIS environment. Core layers included the Wisconsin Wetland Inventory (for existing wetlands), a state potentially restorable wetlands (PRW) layer derived from hydric soils, land use/land cover, and topographic indices, and hydrography/topography layers used to model connectivity and contributing areas. PRWs were identified using hydric soils (including hydric inclusions), practical land-use filters (e.g., agriculture), and a Compound Topographic Index (CTI) derived from slope and contributing area; soil attributes such as water table depth, drainage class, texture, restrictive layer depth, flooding frequency, and ponding frequency were cited as inputs to improved PRW delineation. 

Additional datasets supported service-specific criteria (e.g., land cover/land use, soils, hydrography value-added layers, and pollutant source datasets such as discharge permits and CAFO permits), and a statewide Healthy Watershed Assessment contributed water-quality indicators used in opportunity screening.  

Data limitations were explicitly acknowledged: inconsistencies between wetland and waterway datasets, resolution constraints of hydrography and elevation data, and limited capacity of remote sensing to capture biological condition (notably invasive species and vegetation composition) were treated as key constraints on model reliability.  

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

The principal outputs were delivered through the Wetlands and Watersheds Explorer decision support system, described as an interactive mapping platform enabling users to compare watershed-level service losses and identify high-potential preservation and restoration sites within chosen hydrologic units. The project also produced stand-alone statewide GIS layers and analytic processes underlying four major components: WWAL (watershed-level service context), WSAL (site-level service ranks via GISRAM), nested watershed zooming across hydrologic units, and a wildlife habitat tool that mapped suitable habitat for selected wetland-dependent guilds and scored restoration sites (PRWs) based on proximity to existing habitat. 

Decision relevance was framed as a two-way workflow: users could start from watershed goals (identify high-need watersheds, then select sites to meet goals) or start from a site to understand its likely services and the watershed-level need for those services. The document emphasized screening and prioritization rather than quantified benefit estimation (e.g., no explicit carbon tonnage or flood-damage dollars), and cautioned that mitigation-site ranking was not a quantitative approval tool.  

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was integrated primarily as a justification for strategic siting rather than as an explicit scenario-based modelling framework. Wetlands were framed as contributing to mitigation through long-term carbon storage (despite methane emissions) and to adaptation by buffering increased storm intensity and runoff-driven degradation of water quality; the report stated that Wetlands by Design prioritized wetlands likely to maintain or increase landscape carbon storage capacity. However, the treatment remained qualitative and did not present future climate scenarios, hazard projections, or explicit risk metrics within the ranking framework.  

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic analysis (cost-effectiveness, ROI/NPV, or explicit cost layers) was not addressed in the document. The report asserted that incorporating watershed context could improve efficiency and “cost-effectiveness” of site selection relative to purely site-by-site approaches, but did not operationalize costs in the ranking. 

Implementation logic focused on governance alignment: results were intended to inform WWCT compensation planning frameworks and mitigation banking/ILF investment decisions, yet the document stressed that regulatory acceptance rested with Corps District Engineers and that Explorer outputs required field-collected data to justify selections. Next steps emphasized embedding Explorer outputs into locally developed watershed plans and improving datasets and user experience.  

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Validation was conducted through comparison with independent Level 2 field assessments in the Milwaukee River Basin (approximately 900 square miles), using 50 properties encompassing 157 wetland polygons; most comparisons combined field observation and desktop review. LLWW code assignment accuracy was reported at 78% agreement (123 of 157 polygons), with errors attributed to both source data limitations and model limitations. GISRAM service-rank accuracy varied substantially, from 71% (flood abatement significance) down to 26% (floristic quality), and modeled ranks tended to over-estimate performance relative to field assessments. The report interpreted similar rank distributions between methods as supporting higher confidence for physical-process services (flood abatement, water quality, shore protection) and lower confidence for biologically driven services (floristic quality; fish and aquatic life).  

## 10. Critical Assessment

Methodologically, the document was strong in articulating a coherent multi-scale decision logic that linked watershed needs (service loss) to site opportunity (service potential) and explicitly acknowledged scale-appropriate service selection.  Its analytical transparency was moderate: the architecture (WWAL/WSAL/GISRAM, nested hydrologic units, expert-derived criteria) was clearly stated, but the reliance on expert judgement and qualitative ranks implied normative choices that could materially influence prioritization outcomes.  The validation evidence improved credibility for hydrologic and water-quality services, yet the demonstrated tendency to over-estimate service performance, coupled with low accuracy for biological services, suggested that the tool was best treated as a conservative screening device rather than a definitive ranking for investment decisions.  The absence of explicit uncertainty quantification, cost layers, or future climate scenarios limited robustness for high-stakes planning where trade-offs between feasibility, cost, and future risk drive decisions.  Finally, transferability appeared plausible in principle (the approach was explicitly framed as a replicable watershed method), but the results were highly contingent on the quality and consistency of wetland mapping, hydrography, and elevation datasets, which the report itself identified as binding constraints.","NA","Wisconsin Wetland Inventory (Wisconsin Wetland Inventory); Potentially Restorable Wetlands (PRW) (derived from hydric soils; practical land-use filters); Land Use/Land Cover (Land Use/Land Cover); Hydric Soils (Hydric Soils); Water Table Depth (Soils); Drainage Class (Soils); Texture (Soils); Restrictive Layer Depth (Soils); Flooding Frequency (Soils); Ponding Frequency (Soils); Slope (Topography); Contributing Area (Topography); Compound Topographic Index (CTI) (Slope; Contributing Area); LLWW Classifications (LLWW); WWAL (Watershed Assessment Layer) (LLWW classifications; expert-derived ecosystem-service correlation tables); Hydrography (Hydrography); Topography (Elevation data); Discharge Permits (Pollutant Source Datasets); CAFO Permits (Pollutant Source Datasets); Healthy Watershed Assessment (Healthy Watershed Assessment); GISRAM (Site-level service ranks) (GISRAM); WSAL (GISRAM-derived site-level service ranks) (GISRAM); Wildlife Habitat Layer (Wildlife Habitat Tool)","NA","A GIS-based, multi-scale screening and ranking method across nested watersheds; it assesses watershed-level ecosystem-service decline with WWAL derived from LLWW classifications; it ranks within-watershed sites by ecosystem-service potential using GISRAM; and it refines site evaluation with a wildlife-habitat tool.","Field verification/ground-truthing via independent Level 2 field assessments in the Milwaukee River Basin (≈50 properties, 157 wetland polygons); LLWW code assignment accuracy assessment against field data (78% agreement, 123 of 157 polygons); GISRAM service-rank accuracy validation against field assessments (71% for flood abatement; 26% for floristic quality).","Wetlands and Watersheds Explorer (Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources) ; GISRAM (Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources)","Wetlands and Watersheds Explorer: a statewide web-based decision-support platform used to screen and prioritize wetland preservation and restoration by ranking watersheds on ecosystem-service decline and identifying high-potential preservation/restoration sites within selected hydrologic units (producing outputs such as WWAL, WSAL, nested watershed zooming, and a wildlife-habitat layer for planning). ; GISRAM: the site-level service-ranking component (a Level 1 analogue of WWRAMv2) that translates expert criteria on opportunity, effectiveness, and social significance into GIS queries to yield qualitative site ranks within each watershed for multiple services, informing within-watershed site prioritization.","Wetlands watershed service-context map (flood abatement, fish and aquatic habitat, sediment reduction, nutrient transformation, surface water supply); Site-level service-rank map (GISRAM-based qualitative ranks: low/moderate/high/very high); Nested watershed zoom maps across hydrologic units; Wildlife habitat suitability map for wetland-dependent guilds with restoration-site proximity scores (PRWs).","No","Yes: The NbS targeting prioritizes wetlands likely to maintain or increase landscape carbon storage and to buffer increased storm intensity and runoff, addressing climate mitigation and adaptation goals; the authors demonstrate this by prioritizing sites for carbon storage and flood abatement within a watershed-scale ranking framework, while noting that climate benefits are treated qualitatively rather than via explicit climate scenarios.","No","Sub-national: Wisconsin","The NbS addressed wetland preservation and restoration as natural infrastructure in Wisconsin, prioritizing preservation of existing wetlands and restoration of former wetlands; wetland creation and enhancement were excluded.

Context and Rationale

The document addressed an operational problem in England: practitioners of natural flood management (NFM) and “Working with Natural Processes” (WWNP) required a consistent, nationally available spatial evidence base to *screen* where interventions might be most feasible and impactful, before investing in local engagement and detailed feasibility work. The rationale was explicitly practical rather than theory-driven: the maps were intended to support reference and scoping “during and after landowner engagement on natural flood management,” while simultaneously acknowledging that mapped potential did not compel implementation and could be overridden by farm business or practical constraints.  The methodological philosophy embedded in the user guide was therefore one of *signposting*—using open, nationally consistent datasets to indicate potential WWNP locations and relative potential between catchments, rather than predicting realised hydrologic outcomes or guaranteeing deliverable projects. 

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The explicit objective was to provide an interactive, hierarchical set of maps that allowed users to compare relative potential for WWNP across nested water governance units and then “drill down” to locations where measures could be implemented. The decision context was early-stage planning and prioritisation: users could identify which Management Catchments and Water body Catchments exhibited comparatively higher potential for a selected measure, thereby supporting targeting of further investigation, stakeholder engagement, and coordination with flood-risk authorities.  The guide also framed use as a decision support input rather than a decision rule, explicitly advising that next steps required consultation (e.g., with the Environment Agency on flood need), cross-checking with detailed mapping, and consideration of land ownership and local knowledge. 

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The intervention set was narrowly specified around NFM/WWNP measures intended to influence flood generation and conveyance processes: floodplain reconnection; run-off attenuation features (RAFs); gully blocking as a subset of RAFs on steep terrain; and three tree-planting “woodland potential” categories (riparian, floodplain, wider catchment).  Conceptually, these were framed as process-based measures affecting floodplain connectivity, temporary surface storage, and infiltration/roughness changes via woodland—i.e., adaptation and risk reduction rather than biodiversity restoration or carbon mitigation as primary targets. This framing was reinforced by the logic used to derive each layer from flood-risk and flow-accumulation datasets rather than from habitat condition or climate mitigation metrics. 

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

The spatial scope was national (England), but delivered through a four-tier hierarchy aligned to Water Framework Directive (WFD) administrative hydrological units: Tier 1 overview (River Basin Districts), Tier 2 (River Basin District maps of Management Catchments), Tier 3 (Management Catchment maps showing comparative potential by Water body Catchment), and Tier 4 (Water body Catchment maps showing specific polygons of potential locations).  At Tier 3, the analytical unit was the Water body Catchment, and potential was visualised using a national colour scale that classified each catchment from “limited” to “very high” based on national ranges of potential per catchment.  The Tier 3 interface enabled switching between themes (woodland planting, floodplain reconnection, RAF capacity for 3.3% and 1% AEP, and headwater/non-headwater classification), thereby encouraging comparative screening across measures rather than a single composite index. 

Methodologically, each intervention layer was derived by applying a premise-based spatial filter to national datasets. Floodplain reconnection was inferred where areas of low fluvial flood risk occurred in close proximity to a watercourse, interpreted as likely zones of poor river–floodplain connectivity (potentially due to natural features or embankments).  RAF potential was inferred from areas of high flow accumulation in surface-water flood mapping, on the assumption that such areas could influence the runoff hydrograph via engineered temporary storage.  Gully blocking was defined as RAFs on slopes >6%, interpreted as settings where leaky barriers might be preferable to ponds/bunds or grip blocking.  Woodland planting was separated into riparian (50 m buffer on smaller river networks), floodplain woodland (Flood Zone 2, 0.1% AEP), and wider catchment woodland targeted to “slowly permeable soils” where woodland could reduce runoff by breaking up impermeable soils. 

A key methodological feature was the explicit use of “constraints” as masking layers. A comprehensive constraints layer combined roads/rail, existing woodland, urban areas, peat, and water bodies, among others, and was used particularly to mask tree-planting potential; a smaller subset of constraints was applied to other interventions.  The guide acknowledged that certain flood mechanisms in tidally influenced “transitional zones” were not investigated and thus not mapped in the second tier; these areas were therefore excluded from Tier 1 drilling, indicating a structural limitation in coverage driven by assumptions about process dominance and data suitability. 

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The evidence base was explicitly constrained to open data and Open Government Licence datasets, justified as “fit for purpose” even where inferior to conditionally licensed alternatives.  Core datasets included WFD catchment boundary products (River Basin Districts, Management Catchments, River Water body Catchments), Environment Agency flood risk layers (Risk of Flooding from Rivers and Seas; Risk of Flooding from Surface Water), Ordnance Survey open mapping for display and hydrography, CORINE land cover for urban and peat masking, Forestry Commission National Forest Inventory woodland mapping, OS Terrain (50 m) for slope classification, and BGS 1:50,000 superficial/bedrock geology used to derive a new 100 m gridded proxy for slowly permeable soils.  

The guide also documented data limitations arising from licensing constraints: surface-water flood data supplied by specific local authorities had to be removed due to additional restrictions, implying spatial inconsistency or omission in the national layer.  More broadly, reliance on open datasets entailed an implicit trade-off: national coverage and reproducibility were prioritised over local precision, and the document positioned this as acceptable for screening but not for site design. 

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

The principal outputs were interactive, multi-scale maps and an accompanying open geodatabase of polygon features representing WWNP potential.  Decision relevance was operationalised through (i) Tier 3 catchment-level comparative classes (“limited” to “very high”) that supported rapid prioritisation between Water body Catchments for a chosen measure, and (ii) Tier 4 feature-level signposting of implementable locations within a Water body Catchment.   The Tier 4 “All potential for WWNP” layer combined multiple measures (including RAF variants at 3.3% and 1% AEP and the woodland categories), enabling users to view co-location and potential clustering without performing a formal multi-criteria optimisation. 

Quantification was primarily spatial and ordinal rather than impact-based: the document emphasised area/extent-based comparisons and catchment-level colour scaling rather than predicted reductions in flood peaks, carbon storage, or biodiversity outcomes.  The workflow examples further underscored decision use as comparative screening and prioritised follow-on appraisal rather than direct investment decisions from the maps alone. 

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change scenarios were not addressed in the document. Flood and runoff processes were integrated through present-condition flood risk products (Risk of Flooding from Rivers and Seas; Risk of Flooding from Surface Water) used as proxies for hydrological connectivity, flow accumulation, and storage opportunity.  Risk was therefore framed as an existing hazard landscape, and the analysis treated risk layers as spatial *drivers* for targeting interventions rather than as constraints under alternative climate futures. 

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Formal economic appraisal (cost-effectiveness, ROI, NPV) and financing mechanisms were not addressed in the document. The implementation logic was framed through stakeholder engagement realism: mapped potential did not obligate participation, and practical/farm business constraints could prevent implementation even where potential was indicated.  The document further indicated that prioritisation should consider flood mitigation need, spatial clustering, and sizes of potential areas, and that users should consult relevant authorities and local knowledge—implicitly positioning the maps as an entry point into governance and feasibility processes rather than an implementation plan. 

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

The document evidenced process-based robustness measures rather than statistical validation: it acknowledged a multi-agency steering group, user testing, and an external peer reviewer, which suggested structured expert scrutiny of assumptions and usability.  Methodological limitations were explicitly embedded in scope exclusions (e.g., transitional zones not mapped in upper tiers because flooding mechanisms were not investigated), indicating that model applicability depended on hydrological setting.  Robustness was also constrained by reliance on open data and licensing-driven omissions, which could affect completeness and local accuracy.   Finally, the analytic premises (e.g., low fluvial risk near rivers implying poor connectivity; flow accumulation implying storage opportunity) constituted strong assumptions that were appropriate for screening but would require local verification for engineering design and performance estimation. 

## 10. Critical Assessment

Methodologically, the mapping approach was coherent as a screening tool: it used explicit, premise-based rules tied to nationally consistent hazard and terrain datasets, and it separated interventions into interpretable layers rather than obscuring logic in a single composite index.  Analytical transparency was moderate: key premises and constraints masking were documented, but the user guide deferred detailed methodological parameters to a separate technical report, limiting reproducibility from this document alone.  The conclusions were necessarily bounded: outputs indicated *potential locations* and relative catchment potential, but they did not quantify hydrologic benefits or provide uncertainty bounds, which risked over-interpretation by non-expert users unless the stated caveats were heeded.  Potential biases arose from the choice of proxies (e.g., flood risk layers as connectivity/accumulation indicators) and from open-data constraints, including acknowledged omissions due to licensing, which could unevenly affect some geographies.  Transferability was plausible as a methodological template (hazard-driven targeting plus constraints masking), but scalability beyond England would depend on availability of comparable flood risk, terrain, and geology datasets and on recalibration of assumptions to local hydrological regimes, particularly in tidal or transitional settings that the document itself treated as analytically problematic.","floodplain reconnection; run-off attenuation features; gully blocking; riparian woodland; floodplain woodland; wider catchment woodland","WFD Catchment Boundaries (Water Framework Directive); Risk of Flooding from Rivers and Seas (Environment Agency); Risk of Flooding from Surface Water (Environment Agency); OS Open Mapping (Ordnance Survey); CORINE Land Cover (European Environment Agency); National Forest Inventory Woodland Mapping (Forestry Commission); OS Terrain 50m (Ordnance Survey); BGS 1:50,000 Superficial/Bedrock Geology (British Geological Survey); Constraints Layer (Open data); Riparian Woodland Potential (Forestry Commission National Forest Inventory); Floodplain Woodland Potential (Forestry Commission National Forest Inventory); Wider Catchment Woodland Potential (Forestry Commission National Forest Inventory); RAF Capacity 3.3% AEP (Environment Agency); RAF Capacity 1% AEP (Environment Agency)","Water body Catchment (Tier 3)","Nationwide, premise-based spatial filters were applied to hazard and terrain datasets to produce intervention-specific potential layers (floodplain reconnection near waterways; RAF potential from flow accumulation; gully blocking on steep slopes; woodland planting across riparian, floodplain, and wider catchments), with constraint masking and a four-tier WFD-aligned hierarchy to screen relative priority.","Process-based robustness measures; multi-agency steering group; user testing; external peer reviewer","NA","NA","WWNP potential maps (Tier 3 catchment classes: limited–very high); Tier 4 implementable locations layer (All potential for WWNP); Open geodatabase of WWNP potential polygons (WWNP potential polygons)","No","No","No","National: England","NbS addressed: natural flood management (NFM)/Working with Natural Processes (WWNP) measures to influence flood generation and conveyance, including floodplain reconnection; run-off attenuation features (RAFs); gully blocking on steep terrain; and woodland-potential categories (riparian, floodplain, wider catchment).

"Water & Wetland Systems",6,"Identification of spatial priorities for re-opening wetlands to restore connectivity","Study report (FAO Fisheries Circular)","Illustrates a decision-based approach to identify where targeted actions (e.g. culvert upgrades, invasive removal) will reconnect wetlands and enhance ecosystem function.","https://www.fao.org/3/i7107e/i7107e.pdf","## 1. Context and Rationale

The document addressed a functional degradation problem in the Xe Champhone wetland complex (a Ramsar site in Champhone District, Savannakhet Province, Lao PDR) where hydrological and biological connectivity had been progressively reduced by interacting anthropogenic pressures. It framed “connectivity” in aquatic landscapes as the maintenance of water flow linkages between water “patches” that enable species movement and ecological processes, and argued that disconnection in this wetland arose both from infrastructure that altered flows (micro-dams, weirs, diversions) and from dense invasive plant infestations that physically obstructed channels and accelerated sediment trapping.  The rationale was ecological and livelihood-based: connectivity losses were portrayed as impairing habitat integrity, water quality, and movement/breeding of aquatic fauna including Siamese crocodile and migratory fish, while also constraining local access to fishing grounds and wetland resources. 

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The study’s explicit objective was to identify and map priority sites where “significant disconnection” had occurred and where “re-opening” management would be required to re-instate or improve natural flow patterns.  The decision context was operational and near-term: it aimed to support implementation planning under the CAWA project (December 2017), including delineation of manageable intervention zones, feasibility judgments, and a sequenced workplan with responsibilities and timing for on-ground actions.  The analysis was thus positioned as site-level prioritisation for targeted investments in connectivity restoration (rather than system-wide restoration design or long-horizon planning).

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The intervention strategy was framed as “re-opening” wetlands to restore ecological functioning and connectivity, operationalised through (i) invasive species management (water hyacinth *Eichhornia crassipes* and giant mimosa *Mimosa pigra*), (ii) selective vegetation removal in one case involving a native macrophyte (*Polygonum tomentosum*) treated as a pilot, and (iii) infrastructure modification through installation of a fishway/fish ladder at a weir to restore fish passage.  Conceptually, this aligned with an NbS logic insofar as it relied primarily on ecosystem/vegetation management to re-enable hydrological processes and habitat quality, but it also included a hybrid engineering component (fishway) and did not attempt watershed-scale land-use change. The document explicitly rejected broad eradication goals and instead argued for an “asset protection” approach—prioritising high-value ecological/cultural assets where feasible maintenance could be sustained by communities. 

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

The spatial scope was limited to the Xe Champhone Ramsar Site wetland complex and selected sub-sites (reservoirs, oxbows, and a weir-reservoir interface).  The unit of analysis was not a uniform grid or modelling domain; instead, it was discrete management zones delineated around observed barriers/infestations, with lengths/widths and areas estimated in hectares from field GPS points and on-site dimensional measurements (L×W). 
The prioritisation logic was multi-criteria but qualitative rather than algorithmic: candidate sites were first nominated through desktop review, climate vulnerability assessment (VA) information, and stakeholder discussions; then they were ground-truthed via field visits and community surveys that explicitly assessed cause/status of disconnection, management area size, access feasibility, community support, past management experience, responsibility, timing/frequency, and recommended techniques.  The “combination” of variables therefore occurred through expert synthesis of survey/field notes and project knowledge, rather than through weighting, scoring, optimisation, or scenario modelling. 
Uncertainty treatment was implicit: the document acknowledged visibility/access limits and proposed drone-based surveys for poorly observed areas, and it designated two zones as “monitoring” rather than immediate intervention due to uncertain infestation levels and/or access constraints. 

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The evidence base combined (a) literature and prior studies on connectivity and invasive species impacts, (b) recent climate change vulnerability assessment information highlighting invasive species and hydrological stressors, (c) local government/project institutional knowledge (including prior WCS activities), and (d) primary field data from November 2017 site visits.  Primary data included GPS-referenced site attributes, approximate water depths, infestation descriptions, and community-reported ecological and livelihood impacts, with some gender-disaggregated observations.  Data limitations were partly structural: assessments depended heavily on community perceptions of change (e.g., declining water depth due to sediment accumulation), and inaccessible sites constrained direct observation, motivating the recommendation for drone verification. 

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

The principal outputs were mapped site figures (one per priority site) showing Ramsar/core zone boundaries, conservation zones, and proposed management polygons for invasive plant removal and monitoring areas, alongside tabulated zone areas (ha) and specified “re-opening management required.”  Decision-relevant products included a consolidated management zone table (covering six sites, eight intervention zones, and two monitoring areas) that translated qualitative prioritisation into implementable spatial units and linked each unit to a specific method (manual removal, cut-and-flood, pilot removal, fish ladder).  The workplan further operationalised decisions by assigning timing (e.g., March–April for water hyacinth, May–June for mimosa), frequency (monthly follow-up), and responsibility by village and agencies, thereby functioning as an implementation roadmap rather than a predictive impact assessment.  Quantified impacts (e.g., tonnes carbon, biodiversity indices, risk metrics) were not produced; anticipated benefits (improved fish passage, habitat opening, crocodile mobility) were stated as expected outcomes without measured baselines or counterfactual modelling. 

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was integrated indirectly through use of “climate change vulnerability assessment data” to identify where invasive species and connectivity issues were reported, and through scheduling and feasibility considerations linked to seasonal hydrology (dry season access, wet season inundation).  The document treated climate primarily as a driver of hydrological variability (monsoonal wet/dry extremes) that mediated disconnection dynamics and intervention windows, rather than via explicit future climate scenarios or hazard modelling.  A limited anticipatory element appeared in fishway discussion: vertical-slot designs were suggested as potentially advantageous under “uncertain future hydrological conditions,” but this remained a qualitative design rationale rather than scenario-based performance testing. 

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Formal economic appraisal (cost-effectiveness, ROI, NPV) was not addressed in the document. Instead, feasibility was treated as a pragmatic implementation filter: priority zones were kept small because “feasibilities, costs of management and practicalities for long-term sustainability” constrained what could be maintained.  Livelihood considerations entered as incentive design, notably the proposed use of removed water hyacinth as compost/fertiliser and exploration of handicraft markets, intended to create ongoing motivation for regular control.  Governance/coordination logic was explicit: management was to be community-led with agency support (IUCN/DoNRE/DAFO/FAO), potentially formalised through letters of agreement to sustain responsibilities beyond project timelines. 

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Validation was limited to ground-truthing of candidate sites through field visits, GPS mapping, and community surveys, supplemented by agency/project knowledge.  The monitoring framework proposed repeatable photo-point monitoring (including mobile phone photos) and annual post-wet-season checks to assess invasive species re-growth and to trigger escalation of “monitoring” zones to “control” zones if infestations increased.  However, sensitivity analysis, quantitative uncertainty bounds, and ecological response metrics were not developed. A methodological limitation was the reliance on qualitative judgments (e.g., sedimentation influence, fish/crocodile impacts) without systematic measurement of water quality, hydrodynamics, or species abundance, which reduced the ability to attribute ecological outcomes to interventions. 

## 10. Critical Assessment

Methodologically, the study was strong as an implementation-oriented prioritisation exercise because it linked observed barriers to clearly delimited management polygons, matched them to feasible techniques, and embedded operations in community capacity and seasonal labour constraints.  Analytical transparency was moderate: the decision rules were stated (feasibility, ecological/cultural value, community support), yet the absence of explicit scoring or a reproducible prioritisation rubric limited comparability across sites and reduced auditability of why certain zones were prioritised over others.  Robustness of conclusions about ecological benefit was constrained by the lack of quantified baselines and impact metrics, meaning that expected outcomes (fish migration improvement, crocodile mobility, water quality gains) remained plausible but not demonstrated within the report’s evidentiary framework.  The approach risked bias toward easily accessible sites and communities already engaged with conservation projects, potentially overlooking less accessible but ecologically critical disconnection points.  Scalability was limited because the “asset protection” framing intentionally avoided landscape-wide weed management; transferability to other wetlands would require adaptation where institutional support, social incentives, or hydrological regimes differ, and would benefit from integrating quantitative hydrological/ecological monitoring to strengthen attribution and learning.","invasive species management; selective vegetation removal; fishway/fish ladder installation","Barriers_infrastructure_locations (Field GPS points; on-site measurements); Invasive_plant_infestation_locations (Infestation descriptions; climate vulnerability assessment data; field observations); Native_macrophyte_presence (Polygonum tomentosum; pilot removal); Water_depths (Approximate water depths; field measurements); Disconnection_status_and_cause (Ground-truth field notes; community surveys); Access_feasibility (Field observations; community input); Community_support (Community surveys); Management_responsibility (Agency/project knowledge); Timing_constraints (Project schedule; field notes); Ramsar_core_zone_boundaries (GIS boundaries); Conservation_zone_boundaries (GIS boundaries); Climate_vulnerability_data_related_to_invasive_species_and_hydrological_stressors (Climate vulnerability assessment data)","NA","Delineation of discrete management zones around observed barriers and infestations using GPS points and on-site measurements to estimate area; qualitative, expert-synthesis multi-criteria prioritisation based on desktop review, climate vulnerability data, stakeholder input, and ground-truth field surveys (no weighting or algorithmic scoring).","Ground-truthing of candidate sites through field visits, GPS mapping, and community surveys; supplemented by agency/project knowledge; proposed repeatable photo-point monitoring (including mobile phone photos) and annual post-wet-season checks to assess invasive species regrowth and trigger escalation of monitoring to control zones.","NA","NA","Priority-site maps (Ramsar/core zones; conservation zones; proposed management polygons for invasive removal and monitoring areas); Consolidated management-zone table (six sites; eight intervention zones; two monitoring areas)","No","No","Yes: Economic framing is present through livelihood incentives (use of removed water hyacinth as compost/fertiliser and exploration of handicraft markets) and feasibility/cost considerations as practical filters; however there are no economic outputs or quantitative metrics (no ROI/NPV/cost-benefit) in the outputs, and formal economic appraisal is explicitly not addressed.","Local: Xe Champhone Ramsar Site wetland complex; Champhone District; Savannakhet Province; Lao PDR","NbS addressed: re-opening Xe Champhone wetlands to restore connectivity, via invasive species control (water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes and mimosa pigra), pilot removal of Polygonum tomentosum, and a fish ladder at a weir.

**World Wildlife Fund (2023). *Prioritizing Nature-Based Solutions for Water Management: Assessing Potential Evapotranspiration Reductions Through Riparian Restoration in the Middle Rio Grande, New Mexico*** 

---

## 1. Context and Rationale

The document addressed a structural water imbalance in the Middle Rio Grande (MRG), New Mexico, driven by prolonged drought, climate warming, and persistent consumptive uses. The region had experienced declining river flows (notably a 13% reduction at Del Norte during 2000–2021 relative to long-term averages), compounded by increasing evapotranspiration (ET) under projected warming of approximately 5.4°F by 2050 .

This hydrological imbalance had resulted in New Mexico accruing a 93,000 acre-foot debit under the Rio Grande Compact, constraining reservoir storage operations and exacerbating agricultural water insecurity . Concurrent ecological stressors included habitat degradation affecting endangered species such as the Rio Grande silvery minnow.

The rationale rested on the proposition that riparian evapotranspiration—estimated at 14% of total system outflows and roughly one-third of in-state water consumption (Figure 1, p.5) —represented a potentially modifiable component of basin water use. With 56% of riparian vegetation composed of invasive species (tamarisk and Russian olive) and documented higher ET rates relative to native cottonwood systems (13% higher in one field study), the project argued that vegetation restoration could reduce consumptive losses while enhancing ecosystem condition.

The intervention was framed as a Nature-based Solution (NbS) addressing hydrological scarcity through ecological restoration rather than infrastructure expansion.

---

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The study’s explicit objectives were to:

1. Map the spatial extent of exotic-dominated riparian communities;
2. Quantify potential ET reductions through conversion to native vegetation;
3. Prioritize restoration sites based on water-saving potential and ecological benefits;
4. Develop a geospatial decision-support database with embedded tracking functionality .

The analysis was intended to support investment prioritization, Compact compliance strategies, conservation funding allocation, and water-supply reliability planning. The outputs were designed for use by the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission (NMISC), Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District (MRGCD), Bureau of Reclamation, and restoration practitioners.

---

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The NbS strategy centered on replacing invasive riparian vegetation (tamarisk and Russian olive) with native communities, primarily cottonwood-dominated systems. The intervention was framed simultaneously as:

* A water conservation strategy (reducing ET);
* An ecological restoration strategy (improving habitat structure and biodiversity);
* A climate adaptation response (reducing drought vulnerability);
* A legal compliance tool (supporting Compact deliveries).

Conceptually, the NbS was grounded in water-budget rebalancing rather than carbon mitigation. Restoration was not presented as a stand-alone ecological goal but as an integrated hydrological management tool within a regulated interstate basin.

---

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

### Geographic Scope and Unit of Analysis

The study area encompassed the Middle Rio Grande from Cochiti Dam to Caballo Reservoir (Figure 2, p.10) . The spatial resolution relied on the New Mexico Riparian Habitat Map (NMRipMap v2.0+), which mapped riparian vegetation down to quarter-acre patch size . Satellite ET estimation operated at approximately 30m resolution using Landsat imagery.

### Modelling Logic

The analytical logic unfolded in three stages:

1. Vegetation classification and mapping (Activity 1);
2. ET quantification using energy balance models (Activity 2);
3. Spatial prioritization integrating ET reduction potential into existing Riparian Conservation Opportunity Areas (RCOAs) (Activity 3).

ET was estimated using SEBAL and METRIC surface energy balance models, which calculate ET as the residual of net radiation minus soil heat and sensible heat fluxes. METRIC incorporated auto-calibration against ground-based alfalfa reference ET to improve daily extrapolation accuracy .

Interannual variability and regional ET redistribution effects were to be assessed. Importantly, the proposal acknowledged that clearing exotics may alter groundwater levels or induce secondary ET responses elsewhere, indicating awareness of system feedbacks.

### Variable Integration and Prioritization

Prioritization built upon pre-existing RCOA frameworks developed by NHNM and the National Wildlife Federation. RCOAs were rated based on natural area size, diversity, and restoration potential (broadly cost-related). The innovation introduced here was explicit incorporation of modeled water-saving potential into the prioritization logic.

No formal multi-criteria optimization model or quantitative weighting scheme was described. The prioritization logic appeared additive rather than algorithmic, supplemented by stakeholder input.

### Treatment of Uncertainty

Uncertainty treatment was limited to validation of satellite ET estimates against ground measurements. No formal sensitivity analysis, probabilistic modeling, or uncertainty propagation framework was described.

---

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The study relied on:

* NMRipMap vegetation classifications;
* Landsat 5–9 imagery;
* Climate station data;
* SEBAL and METRIC algorithms;
* Ground ET measurements (eddy covariance and prior field studies);
* Hydrologic model outputs from NMISC’s surface-groundwater integrated model;
* RCOA spatial layers.

Data were to be processed in ArcGIS Pro and delivered via ArcGIS Online, using WGS 1984 UTM Zone 13N projection .

Limitations acknowledged included poor quantification of riparian ET historically and potential regional ET redistribution effects. However, no discussion was provided on classification accuracy of vegetation maps, model uncertainty ranges, or temporal representativeness of satellite observations.

---

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

The primary outputs included:

* An interactive online geospatial map allowing users to click on exotic vegetation patches to view predicted replacement community and estimated ET reduction;
* Interannual ET datasets by vegetation type;
* A prioritized RCOA portfolio for water-smart restoration;
* A restoration tracking system embedded in the geospatial platform;
* A final technical report and dissemination materials .

Decision relevance lay in identifying restoration sites with maximum water-saving potential and ecological co-benefits. However, the document did not quantify aggregate basin-scale water recovery projections beyond referencing ET shares (e.g., 14% system outflows; Figure 1) .

---

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was framed as both driver and constraint. Projected warming was expected to increase ET and reduce river flows by up to one-quarter by 2050 .

The project treated climate risk analytically through its influence on ET modeling and as justification for demand-side interventions. However, no explicit future climate scenarios were incorporated into ET modeling or restoration prioritization. The analysis remained primarily contemporary, with climate projections cited but not dynamically modeled.

---

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic analysis was minimally developed. While RCOAs referenced restoration “cost” broadly, no cost-effectiveness ratios, NPV calculations, or ROI estimates were provided.

Implementation considerations emphasized stakeholder engagement, governance alignment with NMISC and MRGCD, and development of a restoration tracking system. Financing pathways were mentioned (future WaterSMART grants, philanthropic sources), but financial feasibility modeling was not conducted.

---

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Validation relied on comparison of satellite-based ET estimates with ground measurements and reference ET calibration (METRIC).

No sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, or scenario stress testing was described. Potential rebound or offset effects from groundwater responses were acknowledged but not analytically modeled.

Stakeholder workshops functioned as qualitative validation of prioritization outputs rather than technical verification.

---

## 10. Critical Assessment

The proposal demonstrated strong scientific grounding in ET modeling and vegetation mapping, leveraging validated energy balance methods and high-resolution spatial datasets. Its integration of hydrological modeling with spatial conservation planning represented a meaningful advancement over purely descriptive restoration mapping.

However, the prioritization framework lacked formal optimization or transparent weighting criteria, reducing analytical rigor in trade-off resolution. The absence of quantified basin-scale water recovery scenarios limited its ability to demonstrate systemic impact. Economic evaluation was notably underdeveloped, constraining investment decision support. Climate projections were cited but not incorporated into dynamic modeling, limiting forward-looking robustness.

Overall, the project presented a technically credible and policy-relevant NbS framework with strong spatial analytics, but its decision-support strength would depend on subsequent quantification of economic efficiency, uncertainty bounds, and cumulative hydrological impacts at basin scale.","NA","NMRipMap vegetation classifications (NMRipMap v2.0+); Landsat imagery (Landsat 5–9 imagery); ET estimates (SEBAL and METRIC energy balance models); Ground ET measurements (eddy covariance and prior field studies); Hydrologic model outputs (NMISC surface-groundwater integrated model); RCOA spatial layers (NHNM and National Wildlife Federation); Climate station data (climate station data)","quarter-acre patch size; approximately 30 m resolution.","Vegetation classification and mapping of exotics from NMRipMap; ET estimation via SEBAL and METRIC energy-balance models; spatial prioritization by overlaying ET-reduction estimates onto existing Riparian Conservation Opportunity Areas (RCOAs) using an additive, non-optimized ranking.","Comparison of satellite-based ET estimates with ground measurements (eddy covariance and prior field studies) and METRIC reference ET calibration; Stakeholder workshops provided qualitative validation of prioritization outputs.","SEBAL (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Hydrological Processes) ; METRIC (Allen et al., 2005; Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration)","SEBAL: used to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) via a surface energy balance model, calculating ET as the residual of net radiation minus soil heat and sensible heat fluxes; METRIC: used similarly to SEBAL for ET estimation, with auto-calibration against ground-based reference ET (alfalfa) to improve daily extrapolation accuracy.","Interactive geospatial map (exotic vegetation patches; predicted replacement communities; estimated ET reductions); Interannual ET datasets by vegetation type (tamarisk; Russian olive; native cottonwood); Prioritized RCOA portfolio for water-smart restoration (RCOA units with restoration priority rankings); Restoration tracking system (geospatial platform integrated tracking)","No","Yes: They frame NbS as a climate adaptation to reduce drought vulnerability and water scarcity, guiding spatial targeting to areas with the highest ET-reduction potential; outputs include a map of predicted ET reductions by patch and a prioritized restoration portfolio based on water-saving potential.","No","Sub-national: Middle Rio Grande;New Mexico","World Wildlife Fund (2023) assessed NbS in riparian restoration of the Middle Rio Grande, NM, replacing tamarisk and Russian olive with native cottonwood to reduce evapotranspiration.

Context and Rationale

The document addressed the persistent gap in safe freshwater access for rural populations for whom conventional supply options were infeasible or unsafe. It framed rainwater harvesting (RWH) as an intervention primarily targeting settings where groundwater was either technically/financially inaccessible or non-potable (e.g., fluoride/arsenic issues), and where perennial surface water sources were absent or insufficient . The rationale was not limited to present-day deficits: the report argued that climate change would intensify water stress through higher temperatures and greater hydrometeorological variability, including prolonged droughts and floods, thereby increasing both the urgency and the spatial heterogeneity of needs for decentralized water solutions .

Methodologically, the document’s justification was that implementation actors (including the commissioning RAIN Foundation) required spatially explicit evidence to guide where RWH could be feasible and impactful, both as a program-planning instrument and as an advocacy (“lobby”) tool for governments . The report positioned itself explicitly as a practical guideline rather than a scientific evaluation, directing readers to academic literature for deeper discussion of assumptions and accuracy . This framing materially shaped the analytical ambition: it emphasized replicable mapping workflows over empirical performance evaluation of RWH outcomes.

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The document’s primary objective was to recommend an approach for producing maps of rainwater harvesting potential, incorporating both current conditions and scenario-based futures (climate and socio-economic change) . The decision context was strategic spatial targeting: identifying where RWH should be promoted to reach populations with unmet water needs, and where harvested water supply potential was sufficiently high to justify investment .

The report also implicitly supported portfolio decisions by proposing two modelling paradigms: a parametric, suitability-based mapping approach for broad scoping and communication, and a dynamic process-based approach that could evaluate “investment portfolios” (capture surface and storage capacity per person) as decision levers . Thus, the intended decisions spanned program siting and prioritisation (where to work), technology/investment specification (how much capture and storage), and forward-looking planning under climate change (how suitability might shift).

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

Rainwater harvesting was treated as the central intervention strategy. Although RWH is not always categorized as an NbS in the strictest ecological-restoration sense, the report framed it as a nature-reliant water management approach that captures precipitation and stores it through a variety of capture and storage modalities . The Dynamic Approach explicitly generalized “capture” to roofs, soils, and surfaces, and “storage” to tanks, ponds, soil water, and sand dams (including underground storage), thereby spanning engineered and hybrid nature-based features .

Conceptually, the intervention was framed primarily as a drinking-water supply and resilience measure for underserved rural settings, rather than as an ecosystem restoration, mitigation, or biodiversity strategy. The report acknowledged that socio-economic and institutional factors were decisive for success (education, organization, governance, gender, culture), but it deliberately excluded these from the core mapping due to difficulties in reliable spatial assessment, focusing instead on conditions derivable from spatial datasets . This choice narrowed the interpretation of “potential” to a biophysical-plus-proxy-demand construct rather than a full feasibility assessment.

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

The report proposed two analytical frameworks with distinct logics.

### Parametric Approach: Multi-layer suitability synthesis

The parametric framework operationalized “potential” as the product of two composite constructs: “Need” (demand/urgency) and “Success” (biophysical ability to harvest/store water) . It recommended seven spatial layers: population density, land use, access to other water sources, aridity (P/PET), annual rainfall, rainfall variability (monthly coefficient of variation), and soil drainage . The logic was explicitly heuristic and expert-driven: each layer was converted into a 0–1 suitability score using defined thresholds and linear interpolation (Figure 2, p.9), then combined multiplicatively to preserve limiting factors (e.g., near-zero rainfall driving overall potential toward zero) .

The report acknowledged epistemic uncertainty: it stated that science did not support fixed scoring values and that debates existed about additive versus multiplicative aggregation. It nevertheless recommended multiplication as “advisable” due to its treatment of constraints . Optional weighting factors could be applied to reflect study preferences (e.g., downweighting population density if prioritizing remote households), but weights were not grounded in an explicit elicitation protocol or sensitivity analysis .

Spatial resolution was treated as a design choice tied to decision needs; for scoping, 10×10 km resolution was recommended as a practical compromise with global data availability . This implies that outputs were intended for strategic planning rather than site engineering, and the framework implicitly assumed within-cell homogeneity that may not hold in heterogeneous landscapes.

### Dynamic Approach: Daily water-balance simulation with investment scenarios

The dynamic framework modeled the physical processes of capturing rainfall, storing it, and meeting daily demand, while accounting for losses (evaporation/leakage) . Its core outputs were reliability metrics such as the number of days per year that RWH could meet demand under specified capture surface and storage capacity per person—explicitly treated as investment scenarios (Table 1, p.12; Figure 4, p.12) . The report argued that because it mimicked processes, no weighting was required; decision-making entered through the investment portfolio choices rather than subjective weights .

Implementation was proposed via raster-grid simulations repeated per cell, producing maps that were scenario-dependent. The report indicated that standard GIS was insufficient for dynamic spatial analysis and suggested adapting the SPHY raster hydrological model (Python/PCRaster) to represent RWH processes . However, the methodological description remained conceptual: the precise water-balance equations, parameterization of losses, and demand specification were not formalized beyond identifying required inputs.

### Integration logic

The report recommended integrating approaches: the Dynamic Approach generated generic physical potential “for everyone,” while a simplified Parametric Approach should be used to mask/exclude areas with low need (e.g., piped systems or adequate alternative sources) . This integration was logically coherent but introduced a structural assumption: that “need” can be sufficiently approximated by proxy spatial layers, despite earlier acknowledgement that socio-economic determinants of access and success were complex and difficult to map.

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The evidence base was largely composed of spatial proxy datasets and climate products rather than primary field data. For the Parametric Approach, the report listed global public-domain sources: gridded population (CIESIN/FAO/CIAT), ESA GLOBCOVER land use, SRTM drainage networks and lakes, climate datasets (CGIAR Climate Explorer; CRU), precipitation (TRMM; CRU), and soil drainage (HWSD/IIASA) .

For the Dynamic Approach, daily precipitation and daily evaporation were described as the critical data requirements. It suggested using reanalysis-type gridded products and stated that prior comparisons found the “Princeton data set” to perform best, without presenting the evaluation criteria or error statistics . Climate-change inputs were linked to IPCC AR5/CMIP5 and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5), with downscaling required to match analysis resolution .

Data limitations were acknowledged in general terms: local datasets were “often more accurate but more difficult to obtain,” and socio-economic determinants were excluded due to poor measurability via distant data sources . The report did not quantify uncertainties arising from dataset biases (e.g., TRMM/CRU differences, land-cover misclassification) nor from scale mismatches between datasets and intended decisions.

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

For the Parametric Approach, the primary outputs were suitability maps of (i) “Need,” (ii) “Success,” and (iii) combined RWH potential via multiplication . The example outputs (Appendix figures on pp.16–17) illustrated a web-mapping tool interface that displayed national-scale potential categories (e.g., “no potential” through “very high potential”) and supporting factor layers such as land use and “physical suitability” . While the screenshots suggested a discrete classification scheme, the report did not specify classification thresholds for map legend classes; it focused on continuous suitability scoring and multiplication.

For the Dynamic Approach, outputs were explicitly quantitative: days per year of supply reliability under investment scenarios (Table 1, p.12) and time-series examples showing storage dynamics and shortage periods (Figure 4, p.12) . This structure supported investment trade-offs (capture vs. storage) and highlighted seasonality as a critical determinant of functional water security, not just annual totals.

Scenario comparisons were addressed conceptually: multiple investment portfolios and multiple climate scenarios could be simulated. However, the report did not provide full mapped scenario results, only illustrative station-level examples. Trade-off analysis beyond reliability-days (e.g., costs, equity, environmental impacts) was not developed.

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate change was integrated as a key justification and as an analytical modifier. In the Parametric Approach, climate change could be represented indirectly by substituting future rainfall and aridity maps as inputs . In the Dynamic Approach, climate change integration was more structurally explicit: altered precipitation and evaporation time series under GCM/RCP projections could be run through the same daily water-balance framework .

Risk was treated primarily as hydrometeorological variability affecting reliability (drought periods producing shortage days). The report did not operationalize flood risk, water quality risk, or infrastructure failure risk, despite mentioning floods in the contextual rationale. Adaptation metrics were implicitly defined as reliability (days demand can be met) rather than economic damage reduction or livelihood resilience indicators.

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic analysis was largely not addressed in formal terms. The report’s closest economic lever was the “investment portfolio” framing in the Dynamic Approach, where capture surface and storage capacity per person functioned as proxies for investment magnitude . However, no cost functions, unit costs, cost-effectiveness ratios, or financing mechanisms were specified.

Implementation planning was discussed procedurally in the “Planning and Resources” section, listing steps for boundary condition definition, data acquisition, scoring definition, GIS analysis, validation/refinement, outreach/reporting, and conversion to a web-mapping tool . For the Dynamic Approach, additional implementation tasks included integrating RWH processes into SPHY, preparing inputs, running scenario ensembles, overlaying with need maps, and analyzing outputs . Governance, institutional arrangements, and policy integration pathways were not addressed in the document.

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Validation was acknowledged as a step—outputs should be validated and scoring factors refined if necessary—but no validation methodology, benchmark datasets, or performance metrics were specified . Robustness considerations were uneven: the report was transparent that suitability scoring lacked scientific consensus and could be biased by expert choices, and it presented the Dynamic Approach as “unbiased” in outputs due to process representation . This claim was only partially justified, since the Dynamic Approach still depended on parameter choices for demand, losses, capture efficiency, and storage characteristics, none of which were formalized or subjected to sensitivity analysis in the text.

Uncertainty treatment, scenario ensembles, and sensitivity testing were therefore “Not addressed in the document” beyond general statements about method strengths and the possibility of running multiple climate pathways and investment portfolios.

## 10. Critical Assessment

The document provided a clear, operational mapping methodology that distinguished between demand-driven need and biophysical feasibility, and it appropriately emphasized that annual rainfall totals alone were insufficient because seasonality determined functional reliability . Its recommendation to use multiplicative aggregation in the parametric framework reflected a defensible constraint-based logic, but it simultaneously amplified the influence of any single poorly estimated layer, making map reliability highly sensitive to data errors and scoring choices. The report’s admission that suitability scoring lacked a scientific basis underscored the method’s dependence on expert judgment; however, it did not provide a structured elicitation or calibration protocol to reduce arbitrariness.

The Dynamic Approach was analytically stronger for decision-making because it produced interpretable reliability metrics under explicit investment scenarios, yet the report stopped short of specifying the governing equations and parameter assumptions needed for reproducibility and independent scrutiny. The proposed integration (dynamic potential masked by parametric “need”) was conceptually coherent but risked misclassifying need because socio-economic access constraints were acknowledged as critical yet excluded. Finally, the approach appeared scalable for scoping at 10×10 km resolution and transferable across countries using global datasets, but transferability to implementation decisions would require substantially stronger validation, uncertainty characterization, and explicit treatment of costs and governance factors, which were not developed in the document .","roofs; sand dams; underground storage; ponds; tanks","Population density (CIESIN/FAO/CIAT); Land use (ESA GLOBCOVER); Access to other water sources (SRTM drainage networks and lakes); Aridity (CGIAR Climate Explorer; CRU); Annual rainfall (TRMM; CRU); Rainfall variability (TRMM; CRU); Soil drainage (HWSD/IIASA)","10×10 km","Parametric multi-layer suitability synthesis (seven spatial layers converted to 0–1 scores and multiplicatively combined to yield overall RWH potential); Dynamic per-cell daily water-balance simulation (SPHY-based raster model evaluating reliability days under investment scenarios).","Not adressed in paper","SPHY raster hydrological model (Python/PCRaster)","SPHY raster hydrological model (Python/PCRaster) : Employed to implement the Dynamic Approach by running daily water-balance simulations on a raster grid to represent RWH processes (capture, storage, losses), producing scenario-dependent reliability metrics (days per year demand is met) and storage dynamics under investment portfolios for climate scenarios.","Rainwater harvesting potential maps (Need map; Success map; Combined potential map) [categories: no potential to very high potential]; Reliability-days maps under investment scenarios (days per year of supply) [scenario-dependent]","Yes: Climate hazards are treated as a risk to NbS by undermining RWH reliability under hydrometeorological variability and climate change, threatening suitability and long-term performance; the authors demonstrate this via scenario-based futures that alter precipitation and evaporation within a dynamic reliability framework, producing outputs of supply-reliability days under different investment portfolios across climate pathways.","Yes: Rainwater harvesting is explicitly framed as a climate-resilient NbS to reduce drought-related water insecurity, using climate change to justify and guide spatial targeting.

The main inputs for the Parametric Approach were seven spatial layers—population density, land use, access to other water sources, aridity (P/PET), annual rainfall, rainfall variability (monthly coefficient of variation), and soil drainage—derived from global public-domain sources (CIESIN/FAO/CIAT for population, ESA GLOBCOVER, SRTM drainage networks and lakes, CGIAR Climate Explorer and CRU for climate, TRMM rainfall, HWSD/IIASA for soil drainage). The Dynamic Approach required daily precipitation and evaporation data, reanalysis-type gridded products, and climate-change inputs from IPCC AR5/CMIP5 with RCPs and downscaling. The spatial method combined variables via two frameworks: a Parametric Multi-layer Suitability synthesis where each layer was 0–1 and multiplied to yield Need×Success, with optional weights; and a Dynamic daily water-balance model producing reliability days per year under investment scenarios, implemented per raster cell (SPHY-adapted). Validation was acknowledged but not specified; outputs included Parametric maps of Need, Success, and combined potential (10×10 km resolution, national-scale categories) and Dynamic results of days of supply reliability, plus illustrative time-series, with outputs per cell and scenario ensembles.

---

## 1. Context and Rationale

The document was developed in response to the growing global burden of flood risk driven by climatic variability, urban expansion, land-use change, and increased settlement in floodplains. It recognized that traditional flood control approaches—primarily structural, engineering-based measures—had proven insufficient as stand-alone solutions. The report explicitly situated itself within a broader policy transition from “flood control” to “flood risk management,” emphasizing resilience, ecosystem services, and integrated planning.

The guide was framed against increasing meteorological extremes, changing hydrological conditions, and societal drivers such as urbanization and coastal settlement. It acknowledged that while climate change cannot be attributed to individual events, it contributes to extreme weather frequency and intensity. Therefore, the rationale for the intervention was the need for a more holistic, watershed-based, and ecosystem-informed framework capable of reducing risk while preserving ecological functions.

Importantly, the document positioned floods not solely as hazards but also as natural processes that provide ecological and livelihood benefits. This reframing underpinned its integrated flood management (IFM) philosophy, advocating for strategies that reduce harmful impacts without eliminating beneficial hydrological processes.

---

## 2. Objectives and Decision Context

The primary objective of the guide was to provide practical guidance for municipal governments, NGOs, and community organizations to integrate natural and nature-based solutions (NbS) into flood risk management. It aimed to support decision-making across the full project cycle—from preliminary assessment through evaluation.

The spatial analysis and framework were intended to support:

* Investment planning for flood risk reduction
* Strategic selection of structural and non-structural measures
* Risk-informed land-use planning
* Institutional capacity assessment
* Community-based flood resilience planning

Rather than functioning as a quantitative decision-support system, the guide provided a structured procedural framework. It was explicitly not designed as an optimization tool but as a process-based methodology guiding planners through risk assessment, method identification, selection, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.

---

## 3. NbS or Intervention Strategy

The guide classified flood management interventions into:

1. **Structural (Hard/Gray)** – e.g., dams, levees, engineered drainage systems.
2. **Structural (Soft/Green/NbS)** – e.g., wetland restoration, upper watershed restoration, riparian vegetation restoration, rain gardens, swales, infiltration devices.
3. **Non-structural** – e.g., land-use zoning, legislation, warning systems, floodproofing regulations.

Nature-based solutions were framed within the IFM paradigm as interventions that:

* Enhance ecosystem services (wetland buffering, sediment retention, infiltration)
* Promote resilience and adaptive capacity
* Provide co-benefits (biodiversity, livelihoods, recreation)
* Reduce runoff volumes and peak flows

The guide recommended prioritizing non-structural measures first, followed by soft structural (nature-based) solutions, and incorporating hard infrastructure only where necessary. Conceptually, NbS were framed as complementary rather than substitutive to gray infrastructure. The strategy emphasized combinations of measures tailored to watershed position (upper watershed vs. floodplain vs. urban core).

---

## 4. Spatial and Analytical Framework

### Spatial Scale and Scope

The framework operated at the watershed scale as the primary planning unit, recognizing hydrological boundaries as the most appropriate scale for flood risk management. It also addressed nested scales: national, watershed, floodplain, community, and household.

### Unit of Analysis

The watershed and sub-watershed were treated as analytical units. Worksheets guided users to characterize precipitation regimes, soil types, vegetation, drainage patterns, infrastructure, and geomorphology.

### Modelling and Prioritization Logic

The guide did not provide quantitative modelling tools. Instead, it outlined:

* Hazard characterization (magnitude, frequency, exposure)
* Vulnerability assessment
* Institutional capacity assessment
* Watershed characterization

Flood risk was conceptualized as a function of hazard × exposure × vulnerability, although no explicit mathematical formula was presented.

### Variable Selection and Combination

Variables included:

* Hydrological parameters (precipitation regimes, drainage patterns)
* Biophysical attributes (soil permeability, slope, vegetation cover)
* Infrastructure conditions
* Socioeconomic vulnerability
* Institutional capacity

These were synthesized qualitatively through structured worksheets.

### Weighting and Optimization

No formal weighting, scoring, or optimization algorithms were used. Method comparison relied on qualitative multi-criteria evaluation considering environmental, economic, operational, and social dimensions. Trade-offs were explicitly acknowledged but not quantified.

### Treatment of Uncertainty

Uncertainty was addressed narratively. Climate variability and change were incorporated through scenario consideration and historical trend analysis, but no probabilistic modelling or sensitivity analysis frameworks were presented. The guide emphasized iterative planning to accommodate evolving information.

---

## 5. Data and Evidence Base

The framework relied on:

* Meteorological data (precipitation, temperature trends)
* Hydrological data (streamflow, groundwater levels)
* Soil and geological maps
* Land-use and vegetation maps
* Infrastructure inventories
* Institutional capacity documentation
* Community-based observations

It encouraged the use of historical weather data (minimum 30 years where possible), satellite data where stations were lacking, and participatory data collection.

Data limitations were acknowledged implicitly, particularly regarding weather station coverage and institutional capacity constraints. However, no standardized minimum data thresholds were specified.

---

## 6. Outputs and Decision-Relevant Products

Outputs were primarily procedural and spatially descriptive rather than quantitative. They included:

* Watershed characterization reports
* Flood risk assessment data summaries
* Institutional capacity assessment tables
* Method selection review matrices
* Monitoring plans
* Project evaluation templates

Maps were recommended for illustrating watershed features, hazard extents, and infrastructure, but no standardized GIS modelling protocol was prescribed.

Quantified impacts (e.g., reduction in peak flow, economic benefit estimates, carbon sequestration) were not systematically required. Scenario comparisons were qualitative, focusing on combinations of hard and soft methods and trade-off analysis rather than quantified cost-benefit modeling.

---

## 7. Climate and Risk Framing

Climate was integrated as both a driver of hazard and a source of uncertainty. The guide distinguished:

* Climate variability (natural fluctuations)
* Climate change (long-term shifts)
* Extreme events (intensity and frequency changes)

Climate was incorporated analytically through:

* Historical trend analysis
* Consideration of projected changes
* Adaptive planning recommendations
* Monitoring precipitation intensity thresholds

However, no downscaled climate modelling methodologies or ensemble approaches were prescribed. Climate acted primarily as a planning consideration rather than a quantified model input.

---

## 8. Economic and Implementation Considerations

Economic considerations were addressed through:

* Comparative cost breakdowns (capital vs. maintenance)
* Resource planning guidance
* Operational cost estimation templates
* Emphasis on long-term maintenance

Formal cost-benefit analysis, NPV, ROI, or cost-effectiveness ratios were not systematically required. Financing mechanisms were discussed broadly, including public budgets, NGO funding, and public-private partnerships.

Implementation logic emphasized governance, institutional coordination, gender inclusion, stakeholder engagement, and environmental impact assessments (EIA). The guide strongly recommended multidisciplinary feasibility studies before implementation.

---

## 9. Validation, Robustness, and Limitations

Validation was primarily procedural:

* Feasibility studies
* Environmental impact assessments
* Monitoring indicators
* Periodic project evaluations

Sensitivity analysis, quantitative model validation, and empirical performance benchmarking were not addressed in technical detail. The framework acknowledged uncertainty and recommended iterative reassessment but did not provide statistical robustness testing methods.

Limitations included:

* Absence of quantitative modelling tools
* Lack of standardized prioritization algorithms
* Limited guidance on economic valuation of ecosystem services
* Dependence on local capacity and data availability

---

## 10. Critical Assessment

Methodologically, the guide was strong in its systems framing and procedural clarity. It effectively integrated watershed science, governance considerations, and ecosystem-based approaches. Its emphasis on combining structural and non-structural measures reflected best practice in integrated flood management.

However, analytical transparency was limited due to the absence of formal decision-support tools, weighting systems, or quantitative trade-off analysis. The lack of explicit optimization frameworks may reduce replicability and comparability across contexts. The guide leaned heavily on qualitative judgment, which may introduce subjectivity and bias in method selection.

While highly adaptable and participatory, the framework may be less robust for high-stakes investment decisions requiring economic justification. Its scalability depends on institutional capacity, and its transferability to data-poor regions may be constrained without technical support.

Overall, the document provided a conceptually rigorous and policy-relevant foundation for nature-based flood management, but it stopped short of delivering a technically prescriptive modelling or prioritization system.","wetland restoration; upper watershed restoration; riparian vegetation restoration; rain gardens; swales; infiltration devices","precipitation regimes (Meteorological data); drainage patterns (Hydrological data); soil permeability (Soil and geological maps); slope (Soil and geological maps); vegetation cover (Land-use and vegetation maps); infrastructure conditions (Infrastructure inventories); socioeconomic vulnerability (Community-based observations); institutional capacity (Institutional capacity documentation)","NA","Qualitative, structured-worksheet, multi-criteria evaluation at the watershed scale, synthesizing hazard, exposure, vulnerability and institutional capacity without formal weighting or optimization.","Feasibility studies; Environmental impact assessments; Monitoring indicators; Periodic project evaluations","NA","NA","NA","No","No","Yes: The outputs incorporate economic framing qualitatively—they include comparative cost breakdowns (capital vs maintenance), resource planning guidance, and operational cost estimation templates with emphasis on long-term maintenance and financing options (public budgets, NGO funding, public-private partnerships); however, formal economic outputs like cost-benefit analysis, NPV, ROI, or cost-effectiveness ratios are not systematically required, quantified economic benefits are not routinely produced, and scenario comparisons remain qualitative trade-offs across environmental, economic, operational, and social dimensions.","NA","NbS addressed: Nature-based solutions within integrated flood management, focusing on wetlands, upper-watershed restoration, riparian restoration, rain gardens, swales, and infiltration devices, with non-structural measures prioritized.
