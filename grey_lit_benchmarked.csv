However, the need for local calibration, context-specific weights derived from stakeholder input, and the reliance on national datasets make the method moderately transferable; while its framework is documented, it still requires local adaptation and expertise for effective application in different regions.",2,"The document describes the ROAM methodology, which relies heavily on varying degrees of data access and availability based on region-specific surveys and maps. While it mentions the use of stakeholder surveys, national GIS datasets, and locally sourced maps specific to Mexico and Ghana, it does not indicate the use of global datasets that could be consistently replicated in different regions. As such, the analysis is dependent on local or national datasets that would need to be substituted or newly collected in other contexts, making the generalizability limited. Therefore, I would assign a score of 2, reflecting a mixed approach.

However, since it primarily utilizes ecosystem service modeling frameworks (like InVEST), which can accept global datasets, and mentions stakeholder-validated national datasets that might be comparable, it suggests a mixed nature of inputs. Aspects such as impact potential rasters and beneficiary maps imply a certain level of regional specificity, but the abstracted nature of the optimization process can allow for application in different areas if equivalent datasets are used.

Overall, while some inputs may be replicated with equivalent global datasets, others would necessitate local validations, making it a mixture rather than entirely replicable with just global data. Therefore, I would score this as MIXED.

This indicates that while the framework can be applied at various levels, the highest scope in the spatial application is the watershed scale, which encompasses national and sub-national scales",2,"The spatial method described is moderately transferable, as it provides a structured procedural framework for integrated flood management that could be adapted to different contexts, but it lacks formal quantitative models and relies on qualitative assessments that would require local adaptation, such as reassigning weights and tuning regional parameters",2,"The summary indicates that the analysis relies predominantly on locally sourced and community-based observations, alongside specific data types that are not consistently available across regions, such as institutional capacity documentation and localized infrastructure inventories. The mention of meteorological and hydrological data implies reliance on historical weather data and local conditions, but it does not specify whether these data are globally accessible or require local collection. Thus, the outcome would largely vary by region due to these dependencies on local datasets. Therefore, I would classify the generalizability of the datasets used in the analysis as mixed",2,2,2,2,2,Medium,50,Medium,https://c402277.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/publications/1058/files/original/WWF_Flood_Green_Guide_FINAL.pdf?1495628174=
